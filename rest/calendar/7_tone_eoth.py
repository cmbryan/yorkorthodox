# Dependencies: python3, sqlite3, apsw python sqlite wrapper, the datetime module.

# This script determines the Tone and Eothinon for each Sunday and then 
# populates the these columns of the appropriate year table(s).

# First import the SQLite wrapper for Python:

import apsw

# Import the date handling modules:

import datetime
from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta

# Open the database as 'cal' and set the cursor to 'cur':

cal = apsw.Connection('YOCal.db')
cur = cal.cursor()

# Begin:

cur.execute('BEGIN TRANSACTION')

# Get the first and last years to have a table in the database.
# Set initial values and scan for the actual values.

yr = 1999         # We scan upwards from here
yr_final = 2100   # We scan downwards from here

name = ''
while name == '' and yr < 2100:

   if not name: name = ''

name = ''
while name == '' and yr_final > 1999:
   yr_final -= 1
   cur.execute('''SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name= ?''', ('Year_'+str(yr_final),))
   name = cur.fetchone()
   if not name: name = ''

print('Tables for the years '+str(yr)+'-'+str(yr_final)+' will be populated')

# Cycle through the range of years:

while yr <= yr_final:
    
    # Set table name to that of the current year:

    tn = 'Year_' + str(yr)

    # Set reference date for calculations which use the table ids.
    # The last day of the previous year is treated as id = 0:

    base_date = date(yr-1,12,31)
     
    # Get the date of THIS YEAR'S Pascha from the Pascha table:

    cur.execute("SELECT pascha_date FROM pascha WHERE year = ?", (yr,))

    pascha = datetime.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d').date()

    # Get its id on the Year table:
