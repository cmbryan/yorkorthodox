# York Orthodox Calendar Project v2
# Fr Deacon David Hoskin   2018

# Dependencies: python3, sqlite3, apsw python sqlite wrapper, the datetime module.

# Where the cycle of daily lections and their associated codes appears in the annual
# calendar largely depends on the date of the previous and forthcoming Paschas. This
# script binds the cycle to actual calendar dates and populates the Year tables accordingly.
# 
# The A_Lections and G_Lections tables provide the raw data which is then written to
# Year table columns 'a_code' 'g_code' 'desig_a' 'desig_g' 'apos' 'gosp' 'extra' 'x_code'.
#
# The ten occasions when the Liturgy of St Basil is used are marked in the 'basil' column.
#
# The fixed tables 'Pascha' 'A_Lections' 'G_Lections' must already exist and be populated.
# The id column and all the date columns of the year table must already be populated.

# What happens between the Sunday after the Theophany and the start of the Triodion is
# particularly arcane. PLEASE READ THIS FIRST in order to understand the code: 

# The SUNDAY designations and lections between the Theophany and the start of the
# Triodion follow one of several patterns governed by the number of Sundays which need 
# to be filled.

# Meanwhile the DAILY lections follow the Epistle cycle until the Saturday of the 33rd week,
# and the Gospel cycle is followed until the Saturday of the 16th week of Luke.
# The remaining days are filled by repeating a section of the Epistle cycle and of the 
# Matthew cycle so that the Saturday of the 16th week of each cycle is reached on the day
# before the Triodion begins.
#
# Got it?

# First import the SQLite wrapper for Python:

import apsw

# Import the date handling modules:

import datetime
from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta

# Open the database as 'cal' and set the cursor to 'cur':

cal = apsw.Connection('YOCal.db')
cur = cal.cursor()

# Begin:

cur.execute('BEGIN TRANSACTION')

# Set variables for the ids of key points in the Lections tables.
# The Apostle and Gospel entries largely run parallel, so one id sometimes
# suffices for both lections. These variables hold good for any year.

# We need the lection table ids for:
#         Pascha (A1Sun, J1Sun), 
#        The start of the Triodion (E33Sun, L16Sun), 
#         E16Sat and M16Sat for the Saturday before the Tiodion.
#        Also E33Sat and L16Sat. These ids can be taken from the Triodion ids
#            as come immediately before the Triodion ids in the Lection tables
#         Holy Saturday which has the code G7Sat
# We can get all of these from the G_Lections table as those ids will hold
# good for the A_Lections table also: 

cur.execute('''SELECT g_id FROM G_Lections WHERE code = "J1Sun"''') 
lect_id_pascha = cur.fetchone()[0]

cur.execute('''SELECT g_id FROM G_Lections WHERE code = "M16Sat"''') 
lect_id_sat_b_triod = cur.fetchone()[0]

cur.execute('''SELECT g_id FROM G_Lections WHERE code = "L16Sun"''') 
lect_id_triod = cur.fetchone()[0]

cur.execute('''SELECT g_id FROM G_Lections WHERE code = "G7Sat"''') 
lect_id_holy_sat = cur.fetchone()[0]

# Create lists of the Sunday codes for the Sundays between the Sunday after
# the Theophany and the start of the Triodion. 
# With the New Calendar there may be 1 to 6 such Sundays:

# If 1 Sunday, the Apostle and Gospel codes are:
b_triod_1 = [('E32Sun','L15Sun')]

# If 2 Sundays:
b_triod_2 = [('E29Sun','L12Sun'), ('E32Sun', 'L15Sun')]

# If 3 Sundays:

# The lists for 4 or five Sundays depend on whether 14th of Luke was used in
# December. 'L14Sun' is reserved for Sundays falling on Dec 1st, 2nd or 3rd. 

# If 4 Sundays and L14Sun was NOT used:
