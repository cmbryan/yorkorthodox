# This script determines the Fast Codes for each day of a specific year or series
# of years and then populates the 'fast' column of the appropriate year table(s).
# Information about the fast seasons is added to the season column.

# Columns 'id', 'date', 'day_name' and 'date_key' must be already populated.
# The fixed tables 'Pascha' and 'Menaion' must already exist and be populated.

# f3 = strict fast; f2 = wine and oil allowed; f1 = fish wine and oil allowed
