\v 1 A scroll of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
\p
\v 2 Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
\v 3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.
\v 4 Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
\v 5 Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed was the father of Jesse.
\v 6 Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah.
\v 7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
\v 8 Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah.
\v 9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
\v 10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
\v 11 Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylon exile.
\v 12 After the Babylon exile Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
\v 13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
\v 14 Azor was the father of Sadoc. Sadoc was the father of Achim. Achim was the father of Eliud.
\v 15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
\v 16 Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus who is called the Christ.
\v 17 Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the Babylon exile, fourteen generations; and from the Babylon exile until the Christ, fourteen generations.
\p
\v 18 The birth of Jesus Christ was like this. When his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Joseph her man, a righteous man, not wanting to make and example of her intended to send her away quietly.
\v 20 As he was considering these things, look! – an angel of the Lord appears to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, you need not be afraid to take Mary [as] your wife for what is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus for he will save his people from their sins.”
\p
\v 22 Now, all this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled,
\q1
\v 23 “Behold! A virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
\q1 and they will call his name Emmanuel,
\q1 which is translated, ‘God with us.’”\rq Isaiah 7:14\rq*
\m
\v 24 Joseph awoke from sleep and did as the angel of the Lord had told him. He took to himself his wife,
\v 25 and did not have intercourse with her until she gave birth to her son, her first-born, and called his name Jesus.

\v 1 When Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, look! – magi from the east arrive in Jerusalem saying,
\v 2 “Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to reverence him.”
\v 3 When Herod the king heard, he was troubled – and all Jerusalem with him.
\v 4 Bringing together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he enquired from them where the Christ would be born.
\v 5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has been written through the prophet,
\q1
\v 6 ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,
\q1 you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah
\q1 for from you shall come one who rules, who will shepherd my people Israel.’”\rq Micah 5:2\rq*
\m
\v 7 Then Herod secretly summoned the magi and enquired carefully from them the time of the star’s appearance.
\v 8 Sending them to Bethlehem he said, “Go and search carefully for the young child. As soon as you have found him, report back to me so that I too may go and reverence him.”
\p
\v 9 Having listened to the king they departed. And, look! – the star which they had seen in the east goes ahead of them until it comes and stands above where the young child is.
\v 10 When they saw the star they rejoiced with a tremendous joy.
\v 11 Entering the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and, falling down, they reverenced him. Opening their treasures they presented gifts to him – gold and frankincense and myrrh.
\v 12 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned home by another road.
\p
\v 13 Now that the magi had left, look! – an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Wake up. Take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him.”
\v 14 So Joseph woke up and took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt.
\v 15 They remained there until the death of Herod, so what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled,
\q1 ‘Out of Egypt I called my Son.’\rq Hosea 11:1\rq*
\m
\v 16 When Herod realised that he had been made a laughing-stock by the magi he was extremely angry, and he sent and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and its surroundings of two years and under, corresponding to the time which he had verified from the magi.
\v 17 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled,
\q1
\v 18 ‘A cry was heard in Ramah,
\q1 lamentation and wailing and great mourning –
\q1 Rachel weeping for her children
\q1 but she would not be comforted
\q1 because they are not.’\rq Jeremiah 38[31]:15\rq*
\m
\v 19 Now that Herod had died, look! – an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\v 20 saying, “Wake up. Take the young child and his mother and set off for the land of Israel, for those who plotted against the child’s life are dead.”
\p
\v 21 Then, waking up, he took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel.
\v 22 But hearing that Archelaus reigned over Judea in the place of his father Herod he was afraid to go there, and, being warned in a dream, he turned away into the region of Galilee.
\v 23 Arriving there, he settled in a town called Nazareth – so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled,
\q1 ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’
\m
\p

\v 1 In those days John the Baptiser came preaching in the Judean desert
\v 2 saying, “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!”
\v 3 – because he is the one of whom Isaiah the prophet spoke saying,
\q1 ‘A voice crying out in the desert,
\q1 “Prepare the way of the Lord!
\q1 Make his paths straight!”’\rq Isaiah 40:3\rq*
\m
\v 4 Now this man John had for his clothing camel-hair and a leather belt around his waist, and for his food, locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the Jordan countryside went out to him
\v 6 and they were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
\v 7 When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism he said to them, “Brood of vipers! Who taught you to escape from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Well then, produce fruit worthy of repentance.
\v 9 Do not imagine you can say to yourselves, ‘We have a father, Abraham.’ For I tell you that from these stones God is able to raise up children for Abraham.
\v 10 Even now the axe is set against the foot of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit is to be felled and thrown into the fire.
\v 11 I indeed baptise you in water for repentance, but the one following me is more powerful than me, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptise you in the Holy Spirit and fire.
\v 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand and he will completely clear his threshing-floor. Then he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.”
\p
\v 13 At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised by him.
\v 14 But John resisted him saying, “I need to be baptised by you, yet you come to me!”
\p
\v 15 Jesus answered him, “Let it be for now, for it is fitting in this way to fulfil all righteousness.” Then John gave way to him.
\v 16 As soon as he was baptised Jesus rose up from the water and, look! – heaven opens for him and he sees the Spirit of God descending as a dove and appearing over him.
\v 17 Then, listen! – a voice from heaven says, “This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight.”
\p
\c 4
\v 1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil,
\v 2 and after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights he was hungry.
\v 3 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”
\v 4 In reply he said, “It is written,
\q1 ‘No one will thrive on bread alone, but on every word coming out of the mouth of God.’”\rq Deuteronomy 8:3\rq*
\m
\v 5 Then the devil took him into the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple
\v 6 and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 
\q1 ‘He will command his angels concerning you,
\q1 and in their hands they will lift you up
\q1 so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.’”\rq Psalms 90[91]:11-12\rq*
\m
\v 7 Once more Jesus quoted, “It is written,
\q1 ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”\rq Deuteronomy 6:16\rq*
\m
\p
\v 8 Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
\v 9 and he said to him, “All this I will give to you if you prostrate yourself and bow down to me.”
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus said to him, “Get behind me, Satan, for it is written,
\q1 ‘You shall bow down to the Lord your God, and you shall worship him only.’”\rq Deuteronomy 6:13\rq*
\m
\p
\v 11 Then the devil left him and, look! – angels come and minister to him.
\p
\v 12 When Jesus heard that John had been taken prisoner he withdrew to Galilee.
\v 13 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali
\v 14 so that what had been spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,
\q1
\v 15 ‘The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
\q1 the sea’s highway beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles!
\q1
\v 16 The people sitting in darkness saw a great light.
\q1 And for those sitting in the territory and shadow of death
\q1 a light has dawned.’\rq Isaiah 9:1-2\rq*
\m
\v 17 From that moment Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven has drawn near.”
\p
\v 18 Walking beside the sea of Galilee he saw two brothers – Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother – casting a drag-net into the sea, for they were fishermen,
\v 19 and he said to them, “Follow me and I shall make you fish for people.”
\p
\v 20 They left the nets at once and followed him.
\v 21 And going on from there he saw two other brothers – James, son of Zebedee, and John, his brother – in the boat with their father Zebedee mending their nets, and he called them.
\v 22 Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
\p
\v 23 And all over Galilee Jesus would walk among the people, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom and healing every disease and every illness.
\v 24 The news about him spread out into the whole of Syria and they brought to him all who were ill, afflicted with a variety of diseases and suffering torments, the demon-possessed and the lunatics and the paralysed. And he healed them.
\v 25 Great crowds from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up into the mountain and when he sat down his disciples came to him.
\v 2 Opening his mouth he taught them, saying,
\q1
\v 3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit,
\q2 for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\rq Isaiah 57:15; 66:2\rq*
\q1 
\v 4 Blessed are those who mourn,
\q2 for they shall be comforted.\rq Isaiah 61:2; 66:10,13\rq*
\q1 
\v 5 Blessed are the meek,
\q2 for they shall inherit the earth.\rq Psalms 36[37]:11\rq*
\q1 
\v 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
\q2 for they shall be filled.
\q1 
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful,
\q2 for they shall be shown mercy.
\q1 
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart,
\q2 for they shall see God.
\q1 
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers,
\q2 for they shall be called children of God.
\q1 
\v 10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,
\q2 for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
\q1 
\v 11 Blessed are you when they taunt you and persecute you and falsely accuse you of all kinds of evil because of me.
\q2 
\v 12 Rejoice and jump for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.
\q2 Indeed, this is how they persecuted the prophets who came before you.”
\m
\p
\v 13 “You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how can it become salty again? It is then good for nothing except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill can not be hidden.
\v 15 Nor do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand so that it gives light to all who are in the house.
\v 16 In the same way, let your light shine before all so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”
\p
\v 17 “Do not think that I have come to overthrow the law or the prophets. I did not come to overthrow, but to fulfil.
\v 18 Truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away not one letter, not one tiny mark, will pass away from the law until everything is accomplished.
\v 19 Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever keeps them, and teaches them, shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 20 Indeed, I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven.”
\p
\v 21 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not kill’\rq Exodus 20:13\rq* and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be held liable at the Judgement.’
\v 22 But what I am telling you is that all who are angry with their brother or sister without reason shall be held liable at the Judgement. Whoever calls a brother or sister ‘worthless’ shall be answerable to the courts; and whoever says, ‘Fool!’ shall be liable to the hell of fire.
\v 23 So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,
\v 24 leave your gift at the altar and go away, be reconciled with your brother or sister first, and then come to offer your gift.
\v 25 Be reconciled quickly with the one who takes you to court – while you are still together on the way – in case your accuser hands you over to the judge, and the judge hands you over to the warder, and you are thrown into prison.
\v 26 Truly I tell you that you will not get out of there until you have paid the last penny.”
\p
\v 27 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’\rq Exodus 20:14\rq*
\v 28 But what I am telling you is that anyone who is looking at a woman, desiring her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
\v 29 So, if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you, for it is better for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you, for it is better for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.”
\p
\v 31 “It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife should give her a certificate of divorce.’\rq Deuteronomy 24:1\rq*
\v 32 But what I am telling you is that whoever divorces his wife, except in a case of adultery, forces her to commit adultery, for whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”
\p
\v 33 “Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely; you shall repay your oaths to the Lord.’
\v 34 But what I am telling you is not to swear at all; not by heaven because it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth because it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem because it is a city of the Great King;
\v 36 nor should you swear by your head because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let what you say be ‘Yes’ [for] yes, ‘No’ [for] no; for more than that is from the evil one.”
\p
\v 38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’\rq Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21\rq*
\v 39 But what I am telling you is not to respond to evil. No, to anyone who slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other one as well;
\v 40 and to anyone who wants to sue you and take your shirt, offer your jacket as well;
\v 41 and with anyone who conscripts you [to go] one mile, go two.
\v 42 Give to the one who begs from you and do not turn away the one who wants to borrow from you.”
\p
\v 43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbour\rq Leviticus 19:18\rq* and hate your enemy.’
\v 44 But what I am telling you is, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who slander you and persecute you,
\v 45 so that you may be children of your Father in heaven, because he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain upon the righteous and the unrighteous.
\v 46 For if you love those who love you, what have you earned? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 47 And if you greet only your friends, what extra have you done? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 48 Therefore you are to be perfect, just like your Father in heaven is perfect.”
\p
\c 6
\v 1 “Be careful not to do your acts of kindness in the presence others with the intention of being seen by them. If you do, you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\v 2 Therefore, when you do an act of kindness do not blow a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do – in the synagogues and in the streets – so that they may be honoured by the people. Truly I say to you that they have received their reward.
\v 3 But when you do an act of kindness do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
\v 4 so that your act of kindness may be secret, and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.
\p
\v 5 And when you pray do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray in the synagogues and standing on street corners so that they are seen by others. Truly I say to you that they have received their reward.
\v 6 But you, when you pray, go into your room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.
\v 7 When you pray do not say things over and over again like the Gentiles, for they think that with their many words they will be heard.
\v 8 So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
\v 9 But pray like this: 
\q1 ‘Our Father who is in heaven,
\q2 hallowed be your name.
\q1 
\v 10 Your Kingdom come.
\q1 Your will be done,
\q2 as in heaven, so on the earth.
\q1 
\v 11 Give us today our bread,
\q2 sufficient for the day.
\v 12 And forgive us our debts
\q2 even as we forgive our debtors.
\q1 
\v 13 And do not lead us into temptation
\q2 but deliver us from the evil one.
\q1 For yours is the Kingdom, the power and the glory,
\q2 into the ages. Amen.’”
\m
\v 14 “If you forgive others their transgressions, your Father who is in heaven will forgive you too;
\v 15 but if you do not forgive others their transgressions, neither will your Father forgive your transgressions.”
\p
\v 16 “Now when you fast do not become like the sour-looking hypocrites who disfigure their faces so that they appear to others to be fasting. Truly I say to you that they are receiving their reward.
\v 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face
\v 18 so that you do not appear to be fasting – except to your Father secretly, and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.”
\p
\v 19 “Do not accumulate treasures for yourselves on earth where moth and rust erode and where thieves break in and steal.
\v 20 Instead, accumulate for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust erode and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
\p
\v 22 “The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
\v 23 But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light within you is darkness, what darkness [is that]!”
\p
\v 24 No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and the idol of wealth.
\v 25 Because of this, I tell you, do not be anxious about your existence – what you are to eat or what you are to drink; nor about your body – what you are to wear. Is not life more than food, and the body [more than] clothes?
\v 26 Look up at the birds of the air, for they do not sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?
\v 27 Who among you by worrying can add one arm’s length to your life?
\v 28 And why are you anxious about clothes? Think carefully about the lilies of the countryside. How do they grow? They do not work or spin,
\v 29 yet I tell you that not even Solomon, in all his glory, was clothed like one of these.
\v 30 So if that is how God clothes the hay in the field – which is [here] today and thrown into the clay oven tomorrow – all the more you of little faith.”
\p
\v 31 “So do not be anxious, saying, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’
\v 32 Indeed, the people of every nation set their sights on these things, but your Father in heaven knows that you need them all.
\v 33 First set your sights on the Kingdom of God and his righteousness – and all these things will be yours as well.
\v 34 So do not be burdened with care for tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. The day’s own trouble is quite sufficient.”
\p
\c 7
\v 1 “Do not judge so that you may not be judged.
\v 2 Because, in the way you judge others you shall be judged; and the measure you deal out will be dealt to you.
\v 3 How is it that you see the speck in your brother or sister’s eye, but do not notice the beam in your own eye?
\v 4 Or how can you say to your brother or sister, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’ when, look! – there is a roof-beam in your own eye?
\v 5 Hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from of your brother or sister’s eye.”
\p
\v 6 “Do not offer what is holy to dogs; and do not throw your pearls in front of swine, for they might trample them underfoot, and then turn and crush you.”
\p
\v 7 “Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened for you.
\v 8 For all who are asking, receive; and those who are seeking, find; and for those who are knocking, it shall be opened.”
\p
\v 9 “Who among you, if your children were to ask you for a loaf of bread, would present them with a stone?
\v 10 Or if they were to ask for a fish, would present them with a snake?
\v 11 So if you – who are evil – know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him.”
\p
\v 12 “And everything, whatever it is, you want others to do for you, do for them as well; for this is the law and the prophets.”
\p
\v 13 “Enter by the narrow gate, because the wide gate and the broad road lead to destruction and there are many who are entering through it.
\v 14 How small the gate and how narrow the road that lead to life! There are few who who find them.”
\p
\v 15 “Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are predatory wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will recognise them. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 So every good tree produces good fruit, and the rotten tree produces rotten fruit.
\v 18 A good tree cannot produce rotten fruit, nor a rotten tree produce good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown on a fire.
\v 20 So it is that, by their fruits you will recognise them.”
\p
\v 21 “Not everyone who addresses me as ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many will tell me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name?’
\v 23 And then I will say outright to them, ‘I never knew you. Leave me, you workers of iniquity.’”
\p
\v 24 “Now, everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them, I shall compare to a sensible man who built his house upon a rock.
\v 25 Then the rain came down and the floods came up and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall – because it had been founded upon the rock.
\v 26 And everyone who listens to these words of mine and does not act on them, will be like a stupid man who built his house on the sand.
\v 27 Then the rain came down and the floods came up and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell – and its fall was stupendous.”
\p
\v 28 Now, when Jesus finished what he was saying the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
\v 29 for he was teaching them with authority, and not like the scribes.
\p
\c 8
\v 1 When he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
\v 2 Then, look! – a leper appears and is bowing down to him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you have the power to make me clean.”
\p
\v 3 And, stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be made clean.” And immediately his leprosy was taken away.
\v 4 Then Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses prescribed as a witness to them.”
\p
\v 5 When he entered Capernaum a centurion approached him, begging for his help
\v 6 and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying paralysed at home in terrible pain.”
\v 7 Jesus told him, “I will come and heal him.”
\v 8 But in reply the centurion declared, “Lord, I am not worthy that you should come in, under my roof. No, just say the word and my servant will be healed,
\v 9 for I too am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. So I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
\p
\v 10 Now, when Jesus heard [this] he marvelled, and he said to those who were following, “Truly I tell you, that not even in Israel have I found such great faith,
\v 11 and I say to you that many will come from east and west and dine with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 12 But the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into utter darkness, and there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! And in the way you believed [it could be done], let it be done for you.” And his servant was healed at that moment.
\p
\v 14 When Jesus entered Peter’s house he saw his mother-in-law had been struck down and was suffering from a fever.
\v 15 So he touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she got up and began ministering to him.
\v 16 When evening came they brought to him many who were possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word; and he healed all who were ill.
\v 17 In this way what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled.
\q1 ‘He accepted our infirmities and bore our sicknesses’.\rq Isaiah 53:4\rq*
\m
\v 18 Jesus, seeing great crowds around him, gave the order to leave for the opposite shore.
\p
\v 19 Then a solitary scribe approached and said to him, “Teacher, I want to follow you wherever you might go.”
\v 20 But Jesus told him, “The foxes have dens and the birds of the air places to roost, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
\p
\v 21 Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go away and bury my father.”
\v 22 But Jesus told him, “Follow me – and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
\p
\v 23 When he got into the boat his disciples followed him.
\v 24 Then, look! – a mighty storm falls upon the sea so the boat is being completely swamped by the waves. But he was sleeping.
\v 25 So his disciples, coming to him, woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”
\v 26 But he said to them, “Why are you afraid? – you of little faith.” Then, standing up, he rebuked the winds and the sea – and there was utter tranquillity.
\v 27 They all marvelled, saying, “What manner [of man] is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
\p
\v 28 When [Jesus] reached the opposite shore, the land of the Gergesenes, two who were demon-possessed met him, coming out from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass along that path.
\v 29 Then, listen! – they are shouting out, saying, “What are we to you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you have come here before the proper time to torment us?”
\v 30 Now, at some distance from them was a herd of many pigs, feeding.
\v 31 The demons were begging him, saying, “If you expel us, let us to go off into the herd of pigs.”
\p
\v 32 He said to them, “Go!”
\p Then the demons came out. They entered the herd of pigs and, look! – the whole herd of pigs rush over the cliff, into the sea, and perish in the waters.
\v 33 The herdsmen fled; and going into the town they told everything – including the matter of the demon-possessed.
\v 34 Then, look! – the whole town comes out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their shores.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived in his own town.
\v 2 Then, look! – some people bring to him a man who is paralysed, lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralysed man, “Cheer up, son. Your sins have been forgiven.”
\p
\v 3 Then, listen! – some of the scribes are saying among themselves, “This man blasphemes.”
\p
\v 4 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think malice in your hearts?
\v 5 Which is easier? To say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’.
\v 6 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your bed and go home.”
\v 7 And having got up, he went home.
\p
\v 8 The crowds, seeing this, were astonished and glorified God who had given such authority to humans.
\p
\v 9 As Jesus passed on from there he saw a man called Matthew sitting in the tax office, and said to him, “Follow me!” And the man got up and followed him.
\v 10 He was at home, sitting down to eat, and look! – many tax collectors and sinners arrive and sit down with Jesus and his disciples.
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw this they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
\p
\v 12 And Jesus, hearing this, told them, “The healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.
\v 13 But go away and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice’,\rq Hosea 6:6\rq* for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
\p
\v 14 Then John’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast a lot, but your disciples do not fast?”
\v 15 And Jesus said to them, “Can the groomsmen mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast.
\v 16 No one attaches a piece of unshrunk cloth to an old garment because it shrinks, pulling away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.
\v 17 Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins in case the skins burst – then the wine pours out and the skins are destroyed. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”
\p
\v 18 He was telling them these things when, look! – a ruler approaches and bows down to him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her and she will live.”
\p
\v 19 And getting up, Jesus followed him with his disciples.
\v 20 Then, see! – a woman who has been bleeding for twelve years comes behind him and touches the hem of his cloak,
\v 21 for she is saying to herself, “If I can only touch his cloak I shall be healed.”
\p
\v 22 But turning around and seeing her, Jesus said, “Courage, daughter, your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that moment.
\p
\v 23 Arriving at the ruler’s house, Jesus saw the flute players and the crowd in uproar.
\v 24 He said to them, “Get out! For the girl has not died but is sleeping.” And they started laughing at him.
\v 25 When the crowd was driven out he went in, took hold of her hand, and the little girl was raised up.
\v 26 And the news of this spread throughout the land.
\p
\v 27 As Jesus pressed on from there, two who were blind followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David.”
\p
\v 28 When he reached the house the blind people approached him, and Jesus asked them, “Do you believe that I am able do this?”
\p They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
\p
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, “In accordance with your faith, let it be done for you.”
\v 30 And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them, saying, “See that no one knows,”
\v 31 but when they left they publicized it throughout that district.
\p
\v 32 Then, as they were leaving, look! – they are bringing to him someone who can not speak, who is possessed by a demon.
\v 33 And when the demon had been cast out the one who could not speak began speaking. And the crowd marvelled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of demons he casts out demons.”
\p
\v 35 So Jesus was travelling around the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and all kinds of infirmity among the people.
\p
\v 36 Seeing the crowds he was moved with compassion for them, because they were lost and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
\v 37 Then he said to his disciples, “Yes, the harvest is plentiful, but the labourers too few.
\v 38 So beg the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest.”
\p
\c 10
\v 1 He called together his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and illness.
\v 2 The names of the Twelve Apostles are: first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;
\v 3 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, the one called Thaddaeus;
\v 4 Simon the Canaanite; and Judas – Iscariot – who did indeed betray him.
\p
\v 5 Jesus sent the Twelve out and gave them this instruction, “Do not go among the Gentiles and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
\v 6 Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 As you go, preach and say, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.’
\v 8 Heal the sick; make the lepers clean; raise the dead; and cast out demons. You have received freely; give freely.
\v 9 Do not take any gold, silver or copper in your money belts.
\v 10 Do not take a bag for your journey, or two coats, or shoes, or staff: the one who works is worthy of his food.
\v 11 As you enter any town or village, find out who is worthy and stay there until you go on.
\v 12 As you enter the household, greet it saying, ‘Peace to this house’.
\v 13 If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
\v 14 If some place does not receive you and does not hear your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or that town.
\v 15 Truly I tell you that on the day of judgement it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.”
\p
\v 16 “Listen! I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
\v 17 But beware of the people, for they will hand you over to Sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will flog you;
\v 18 and for my sake you will be brought before governors and kings as a witness to them and to the Gentiles.
\v 19 But when they hand you over do not worry about how or what you will say. What you are to say will be given to you at that time,
\v 20 for it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.”
\p
\v 21 “Brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against their parents and put them to death,
\v 22 and you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end, that one shall be saved.
\v 23 When they persecute you in this town, flee to another. Truly I tell you that you you will not have finished going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.”
\p
\v 24 “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and for the servant like his master. If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household.
\v 26 So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not become known.
\v 27 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
\v 28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but can not kill the soul. Rather, fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”
\p
\v 29 “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Not one of them falls to the ground without your Father’s consent.
\v 30 As for you, even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 So do not be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
\v 32 Everyone who confesses me in the presence of others, I too will confess in the presence of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever disowns me in the presence of others, I too will disown in the presence of my Father who is in heaven.”
\p
\v 34 “Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
\v 35 Yes, I came to set a son against his father, a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\v 36 One’s enemies are those of one’s own household.”
\p
\v 37 “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\v 38 Those who do not accept their cross and follow after me are not worthy of me.
\v 39 Those who save their life will lose it, but those who lose their life for my sake will find it.
\v 40 Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
\v 41 Whoever receives a prophet for being a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. Whoever receives a righteous person for being righteous will receive the reward of the righteous.
\v 42 Truly I tell you that those who give one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink for being a disciple will not lose their reward.”
\p
\c 11
\v 1 When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he left that place to teach and to preach in their towns.
\p
\v 2 Now John, hearing in prison what the Christ was doing, dispatched two of his disciples
\v 3 to ask him, “Are you the one who is coming or are we looking for someone else?”
\p
\v 4 Jesus replied to them, “Go and report to John what you are hearing and seeing:
\v 5 the blind are recovering their sight and the lame are walking; lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing; the dead are being raised and the poor are being brought the Gospel
\v 6 – and blessed is the one who is not offended by me.”
\p
\v 7 As they were leaving, Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John. “What did you go out into the desert to look at? A reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 8 No? What did you go out to see? A man dressed in elegant clothing? Listen, those who wear elegant clothes are in royal palaces.
\v 9 No? What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes! I am telling you, even more than prophet!
\v 10 For he is the one of whom it is written,
\q1 ‘Behold! I am sending my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way before you.’\rq Malachi 3:1\rq*
\m
\v 11 Truly I say to you, there has not arisen among those born of women anyone greater than John the Baptiser, yet the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
\v 12 From the days of John the Baptiser until now the Kingdom of Heaven has been suffering violence, and the violent have been seizing it by force,
\v 13 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
\v 14 If you are willing to accept it, this is Elijah who was predicted to be coming.
\v 15 Let those who have ears for listening, listen.
\p
\v 16 To what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places, calling out to their friends,
\v 17 saying, ‘We played the pipe for you but you did not dance! We sang a lament for you but you did not beat your breast!’
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, so they say, ‘He has a demon.’
\v 19 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, so they say, ‘Look! – the man is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But Wisdom is shown to be righteous by her children.”
\p
\v 20 Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they had not repented.
\v 21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles which were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 Indeed, I am telling you that it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the Day of Judgement than for you.
\v 23 And you, Capernaum, who have been raised up to heaven – you shall be thrust down to hades, for if the miracles which were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to the present day.
\v 24 Indeed, I am telling you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the Day of Judgement than for you.”
\p
\v 25 At that time Jesus spoke out, saying, “I acknowledge to you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants.
\v 26 Yes, Father, because this was pleasing in your sight.
\p
\v 27 Everything has been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and the one to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him.”
\p
\v 28 “Come to me all you who labour and are overburdened and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me because I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
\p
\c 12
\v 1 At that time Jesus was walking through a cornfield on the Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry and began plucking heads of grain and eating.
\v 2 When the Pharisees noticed they said to him, “Look! – your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.”
\p
\v 3 But he replied to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry – he and those who were with him?
\v 4 How he went into the house of God and ate the show bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the priests?\rq 1 Kingdoms[1 Sam] 21:3-6\rq*
\v 5 Or have you not read in the law that, on the Sabbath, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are without guilt?
\v 6 But I tell you that someone greater than the temple is here.
\v 7 If you had known what this [means], ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice’\rq Hosea 6:6\rq* you would not have condemned those without guilt,
\v 8 for the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
\p
\v 9 Then, moving on from there, he entered their synagogue
\v 10 and, look! – a man with a withered hand is there. And, so that they might make an accusation against him, they questioned him, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
\p
\v 11 He asked them, “Which of you has a sheep? If that [sheep] were to fall into a ditch on the Sabbath, would you not grab hold of it and lift it out?
\v 12 And a human being is much more valuable than a sheep. So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”
\v 13 Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand”, and he stretched it out; and it was restored to health, just like the other.
\v 14 But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
\v 15 Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Great crowds followed him and he healed them all.
\v 16 But he told them not to make him known
\v 17 so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,
\q1
\v 18 ‘Behold! My servant whom I have chosen,
\q1 my beloved in whom my soul delights.
\q1 I shall put my Spirit upon him
\q1 and he will proclaim judgement to the nations.
\q1
\v 19 He will not rampage or roar;
\q1 nor shall anyone hear his voice raised in the streets.
\q1
\v 20 A bruised reed he will not break,
\q1 a smouldering wick he will not snuff out,
\q1 until he brings justice to victory
\q1
\v 21 and in his name the nations hope.’\rq Isaiah 42:1-4\rq*
\m
\p
\v 22 Then someone demon-possessed, blind and unable to speak, was brought to him, and he healed him. So the one who had been blind and unable to speak could both speak and see,
\v 23 and the crowds were all amazed and were saying, “Is this not the Christ, the Son of David?”
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard they said, “This man can only cast out demons by Beelzebul, prince of the demons.”
\p
\v 25 Jesus, knowing what they were thinking, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to nothing; and no city or household divided against itself survives.
\v 26 And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. So how does his kingdom survive?
\v 27 And if I, by Beelzebul, cast out demons, by whom do your own people cast them out? Because of this, they shall be your judges.
\v 28 But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out demons, then truly the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 Or how can someone enter a strong man’s house and seize his possessions, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
\p
\v 30 Whoever is not with me, is against me; and whoever is not gathering with me, is scattering.
\v 31 This is why I am telling you that human beings shall be forgiven every sin and blasphemy, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven them.
\v 32 So if any should speak a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven them, but if any speak against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven them – not now, in this age, nor in the one which is to come.
\p
\v 33 Either produce a good tree and its fruit will be good, or produce a rotten tree and its fruit will be rotten – for the tree is known by its fruit.
\v 34 Brood of vipers! Being evil, how can you say anything good? For the mouth speaks what overflows from the heart.
\v 35 Good people come out with good things from [their] store of goodness, and evil people come out with evil things from [their] store of evil.
\v 36 I tell you that for every idle word people speak, they shall settle an account for it on the Day of Judgement.
\v 37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”
\p
\v 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke up, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
\p
\v 39 But he responded by saying to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but a sign shall not be granted to it – except for the sign of the prophet Jonah.
\v 40 For just as the prophet Jonah was in the interior of the sea-monster for three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
\v 41 Men of Nineveh will stand up at the Judgement with this generation, and they shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But, see! – someone greater than Jonah is here.
\v 42 The Queen of the South will stand up at the Judgement with this generation, and she shall condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But, see! – someone greater than Solomon is here.
\p
\v 43 Now when an unclean spirit leaves a person it wanders through waterless places seeking respite, but does not find [it].
\v 44 Then it says, ‘I will go back home, from where I came.’ And when it arrives it finds it vacant and swept and decorated.
\v 45 It then sets off and teams up with seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. So that person ends up worse off than at the beginning. That is how it will be for this evil generation.”
\p
\v 46 While he continued speaking to the crowds, look! – his mother and his brothers are standing outside, wanting to talk to him.
\v 47 Someone told him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.”
\p
\v 48 But he responded, saying to the speaker, “Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?”
\v 49 Then, stretching out his hand towards his disciples, he said, “See! – my mother and my brothers.
\v 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”
\p
\c 13
\v 1 On that day Jesus left the house and was sitting beside the sea.
\v 2 But because great crowds gathered around him he got into a boat and sat down, while the whole crowd stood on the shore.
\v 3 Then he told them many things in parables. He said, “Listen! The sower went out to sow,
\v 4 and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the wayside; and the birds came and ate them up.
\v 5 Others fell on stony ground where they had little soil. They sprouted immediately because they had no depth of earth,
\v 6 but when the sun came up they were scorched, and since they had no root they withered.
\v 7 Others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them.
\v 8 Others fell on good soil and began producing fruit – some a hundred times over and some sixty and some thirty.
\v 9 Those who have ears should listen.”
\p
\v 10 Then the disciples approached him and asked, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
\p
\v 11 He replied, saying to them, “To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it has not been granted.
\v 12 For to those who have, it shall be given, and they will have more then enough; but from those who do not have, even what they have shall be taken away.
\v 13 That is why I am speaking to them in parables, so that when looking they might not see, and when listening they might not hear – nor understand, nor ever turn back, 
\v 14 so finally, for them, Isaiah’s prophecy might be fulfilled. It says,
\q1 ‘By listening you shall hear, but you will not understand;
\q1 looking you shall see, but you will not perceive.
\q1
\v 15 For the heart of this people has become hard;
\q1 they barely listen with their ears and they close their eyes
\q1 in order not see with the eyes nor hear with the ears
\q1 nor understand with the heart;
\q1 nor turn back so that I can heal them.’\rq Isaiah 6:9-10\rq*
\m
\p
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
\v 17 Truly, I tell you that many prophets and righteous ones longed to see what you see, but they did not see; and to hear what you hear, but they did not hear.
\p
\v 18 So listen to the parable of the sower.
\v 19 When all are listening to the word of the Kingdom but without understanding, [it is because] the evil one comes and carries away what has been sown in their hearts: this is what was sown by the wayside.
\v 20 And that sown on stony ground: these are the ones who hear the word and at once accept [it] joyfully and take hold of it.
\v 21 But they have no root of their own and are short-lived; when affliction or persecution happens because of the word these immediately stumble.
\v 22 And that sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word, but the distractions of this age and the delusion of wealth throttle the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 And that sown on good soil: these are the ones who hear the word and understand; who then produce fruit and bear, some a hundred times over and some sixty and some thirty.”
\p
\v 24 He set before them another parable, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like someone sowing good seed in his field.
\v 25 Then, while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel\f 13:25 \ft Darnel is the poisonous ryegrass, Lolium tremulentum.\f* among the wheat, and went away.
\v 26 So when the crop germinated and produced growth the darnel also appeared.
\v 27 The householder’s servants went and told him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? So where has the darnel come from?’
\p
\v 28 He said to them, ‘Someone – an enemy – has done this.’
\p The servants asked him, ‘So, do you want us to go and gather it up?’
\p
\v 29 But he said, ‘No. While gathering up the darnel you might uproot the wheat with it.
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers to gather up the darnel first, and bind it in bundles before burning it. Then gather up the wheat into my barn.’”
\p
\v 31 He set before them another parable, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.
\v 32 Although the smallest of all seeds, when fully grown it is the largest of all the edible plants – becoming a tree in as much as the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.”
\p
\v 33 He told them another parable. “The kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast which a woman took and mixed with a bushel\f 13:33 \ft Lit. ‘three sata’. 1 saton = 3 gallons approx.\f* of flour until it was all leavened.”
\p
\v 34 All of this Jesus told the crowds in parables; and not once did he speak to them except in a parable
\v 35 so that what had been said through the prophet might be fulfilled,
\q1 ‘I will open my mouth in parables;
\q1 I will breathe out things hidden from the foundation of the world.’\rq Psalms 77[78]:2\rq*
\m
\p
\v 36 Then, dismissing the crowds, he went home. And his disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field.”
\p
\v 37 In reply he told them, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
\v 38 The field is the world. The good seed – these are the children of the Kingdom. The darnel [seeds] are the children of the evil one,
\v 39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the very end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
\v 40 So just as the darnel is collected and consumed by fire, so will it be at the very end of this age.
\v 41 The Son of Man shall send out his angels; and they will gather up from his Kingdom all that offends and those who do evil,
\v 42 and will throw them into the fiery furnace. There will be wailing and the gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then shall the righteous shine out like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Those who have ears should listen.
\p
\v 44 Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure buried in the field which someone found and hid, and in his joy he goes and sells everything, all he has, and buys that field.
\p
\v 45 Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like someone, a dealer, looking for fine pearls,
\v 46 who found one extremely valuable pearl, went away and sold everything, all he had, and bought it.
\p
\v 47 Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a seine-net which was cast into the sea and enclosed [fish] of every kind.
\v 48 When it was full they hauled it up onto the beach. Then, sitting down, they collected the good ones into buckets and threw the rotten ones away.
\v 49 This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
\v 50 Then they will throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be wailing and the gnashing of teeth.”
\p
\v 51 Jesus asked them, “Have you understood all these things?”
\p They told him, “Yes, Lord.”
\p
\v 52 He said to them, “That is why every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a person, a householder, who brings out of his storeroom new things and old.”
\p
\v 53 Then, when Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place.
\v 54 Returning to his home town, he began teaching them in their synagogue with the result that they were astonished, saying, “Where did this man [get] this wisdom? – and the miracles!
\v 55 Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is his mother not called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?
\v 56 And his sisters – are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man [get] all this?”
\v 57 And they took offence at him.
\p So Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honour except in his home town and in his house.”
\v 58 And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
\p
\c 14
\v 1 At that time the news about Jesus came to the ears of Herod the Tetrarch,
\v 2 and he said to his ministers, “This is John the Baptiser. He has risen from the dead and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.”
\v 3 For Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip;
\v 4 because John had told him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
\v 5 Although he wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the common people because they held him to be a prophet.
\v 6 But when Herod’s birthday came round, Herodias’s daughter danced among them and delighted Herod,
\v 7 with the result that, with an oath, he promised to give her whatever she might ask.
\v 8 Then, prompted by her mother, “Give me” she declared, “here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptiser.”
\p
\v 9 And the king was grieved. But because of his oaths – and those dining with him – he ordered that it be brought.
\v 10 He dispatched [his men] to behead John in the prison cell,
\v 11 and his head was brought on a platter, given to the young woman, and she took it to her mother.
\p
\v 12 Then John’s disciples came, took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
\v 13 When Jesus heard, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself. But the crowds, hearing [about it], followed him on foot from the towns.
\p
\v 14 Jesus, stepping out, saw a great crowd and had compassion on them, and he healed their sick.
\v 15 Evening came. His disciples went to him, saying, “This place is deserted and the hour is now late. Let the crowds go so that they may go into the villages to buy food for themselves.”
\p
\v 16 But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them [something] to eat.”
\p
\v 17 They replied, “We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.”
\p
\v 18 He said, “Bring them here to me.”
\v 19 Telling the crowds to sit down on the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke [them]. He gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds;
\v 20 and they all ate and were satisfied. Then they took up the left over fragments – twelve baskets full.
\v 21 Those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides the women and children.
\p
\v 22 Then, without delay Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the far shore while he dismissed the crowds.
\p
\v 23 Having dismissed the crowds, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. Evening came and he was there alone.
\v 24 Meanwhile, the boat was now in the middle of the sea, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against [them].
\v 25 In the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them, walking upon the sea.
\v 26 Then the disciples, when they saw him walking on the sea, were agitated, saying, “It is a ghost,” and they shrieked with fear.
\v 27 But at once Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”
\p
\v 28 Answering him, Peter said, “Lord, if it is you, call me to come to you over the water.”
\p
\v 29 And he said, “Come!”
\p Then, stepping out of the boat, Peter walked on the water to go to Jesus,
\v 30 but seeing the strength of the wind he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”
\p
\v 31 At once Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him and said to him, “You of little faith! Why did you doubt?”
\v 32 And when they got into the boat the wind dropped.
\v 33 Then those who were in the boat came and bowed down to him, saying, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”
\p
\v 34 When they had crossed over they landed in Gennesaret.
\v 35 The local men, recognising him, sent out into the whole of the surrounding countryside and brought to him all who were ill,
\v 36 and they were begging him that at least they might touch just the hem of his cloak. And all those who touched were made completely whole.
\p
\c 15
\v 1 Then they came to Jesus from Jerusalem – scribes and Pharisees – saying,
\v 2 “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they do not ceremonially wash their hands whenever they eat bread.”
\p
\v 3 Answering them, he said, “And why do you disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
\v 4 For God commanded, saying, ‘Honour father and mother’ and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother, let them meet their end in death.’\rq Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9\rq*
\v 5 But you say, ‘Anyone who tells father or mother, “Whatever you might have had from me [is now] a votive offering” shall not honour his or her father or mother.’
\v 6 So you have annulled the commandment of God by your tradition.
\v 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah rightly prophesied about you, saying,
\q1
\v 8 ‘These people approach me with their mouth
\q1 and honour me with their lips,
\q1 but their heart is far from me.
\q1
\v 9 They bow down to me in vain,
\q1 teaching teachings which are instructions of human origin.’\rq Isaiah 29:13\rq*
\m
\v 10 And, calling the crowd close, he said to them, “Listen and learn.
\v 11 [It is] not what goes into the mouth that pollutes a person, but what comes out of the mouth – that pollutes the person.”
\p
\v 12 Then his disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees, hearing what you said, were offended?”
\p
\v 13 Answering, he said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted shall be uprooted.
\v 14 Let them be. They are blind leaders of the blind, and if a blind person is leading a blind person, both will fall into a ditch.”
\p
\v 15 Peter responded and said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said, “Are you, too, still without understanding?
\v 17 Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes on into the intestines and is expelled into the sewer?
\v 18 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and they pollute the person.
\v 19 For evil thoughts come out of the heart – murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, perjuries, blasphemies.
\v 20 These are what pollute a person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not pollute the person.”
\p
\v 21 Jesus, leaving that place, withdrew into the districts of Tyre and Sidon.
\p
\v 22 Then, look! – a woman, a Canaanite from those borderlands, emerges, crying out to him, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is diseased, possessed by a demon.”
\p
\v 23 But he answered her not a word.
\p His disciples came to him and begged him, “Send her away because she is calling after us.”
\p
\v 24 He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
\p
\v 25 Now she, coming forward, bowed down to him saying, “Lord, help me.”
\p
\v 26 But he answered, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the puppies.”
\p
\v 27 So she replied, “That is true, Lord. Even so, the puppies live off the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
\p
\v 28 Answering, Jesus said to her, “Woman, your faith is very great; may what you want be done for you.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus, passing on from there, arrived beside the sea of Galilee, and going up the mountain he was sitting there.
\v 30 And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, those unable to speak, the maimed and many others. And they placed them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them.
\v 31 So then the crowds marvelled when they witnessed the [result] – hearing those unable to speak speaking, [seeing] the maimed made whole, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
\p
\v 32 Jesus called his disciples close and said, “I have compassion on the crowd because, for three days now, they have stayed with me and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry for perhaps they might collapse on the road.”
\p
\v 33 And his disciples said to him, “Where in a wilderness are we to [get] enough loaves to satisfy such a large crowd?”
\v 34 So Jesus asked them, “How many loaves do you have?”
\p and they replied, “Seven. And a few small fish.”
\p
\v 35 He then told the crowds to sit down on the ground,
\v 36 and taking the seven loaves and the fish, he gave thanks and broke [them]. He gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds;
\v 37 and they all ate and were satisfied. Then they took up the left over fragments – seven baskets full.
\v 38 Those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides the women and children.
\v 39 Then, dismissing the crowds, he got into the boat and arrived in the region of Magdala.
\p
\c 16
\v 1 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, testing. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
\v 2 But in answer he said to them, “When it is evening, you say, ‘Fair weather! For the sky is red.’
\v 3 And in the morning, ‘Stormy today! For the sky is red, threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to read the appearance of the sky, but you can not understand the signs of the times.
\v 4 An evil and adulterous generation searches for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.” And abandoning them, he moved on.
\p
\v 5 Then his disciples reached the far shore, forgetting to bring bread.
\v 6 Jesus said to them, “Watch out, and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
\p
\v 7 They discussed [this] among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”
\p
\v 8 Jesus knew, and said, “You of little faith! Why are you discussing among yourselves that you have brought no bread?
\v 9 Do you still not understand? Nor remember the five thousand’s five loaves – and how many baskets you collected?
\v 10 Nor the four thousand’s seven loaves – and how many baskets you collected?
\v 11 How do you not understand that I spoke, not about bread, [when I told] you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?”
\v 12 Then they understood that he did not mean ‘beware of bread yeast’ – but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\p
\v 13 When Jesus arrived in the district of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples, “Who do people say I am – the Son of Man?”
\p
\v 14 They replied, “Some, John the Baptiser; others, Elijah; or else Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
\p
\v 15 He said to them, “But you – who do you say I am?”
\p
\v 16 Then Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
\p
\v 17 And in response, Jesus told him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed [this] to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it.
\v 19 And I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”
\v 20 Then he instructed his disciples to tell no one that he, Jesus, is the Christ.
\p
\v 21 From then on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and to suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be put to death, and to be raised up on the third day.
\p
\v 22 But Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him, saying, “God's mercy to you, Lord! For you, this shall never be.”
\p
\v 23 Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me Satan. You are a hindrance to me, for you are not thinking in God’s terms but in human terms.”
\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If there are those who want to follow me, let them deny themselves, take up their cross, and come with me.
\v 25 For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake shall discover it.
\v 26 For how are people better off if they win the whole world and lose their life? Indeed, what can anyone give in exchange for their life?
\v 27 Because the Son of Man shall certainly come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he or she has done.
\v 28 Truly I tell you, there are some among those standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.”
\p
\c 17
\v 1 Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John, and brought them up to a high mountain by themselves,
\v 2 and he was transfigured in their presence. His face shone like the sun and his clothes became white, just like light.
\v 3 Then, look! – Moses and Elijah appear to them, conversing with him.
\p
\v 4 So Peter spoke up and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, we might make three shelters here – one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
\p
\v 5 While he was still speaking, look! – a bright cloud overshadows them and, listen! – a voice is coming from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I am well pleased. Attend to him.”
\p
\v 6 When the disciples heard it they fell on their faces, for they were absolutely terrified.
\v 7 But Jesus came and touched them, and said, “Get up – and do not be afraid.”
\v 8 And, raising their eyes, they saw no one – except Jesus, alone.
\v 9 Then, as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus gave them an order, saying “Tell no one what you have seen until the Son of Man rises from the dead.”
\p
\v 10 His disciples then questioned him, saying, “So why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
\p
\v 11 In reply, Jesus told them, “Elijah does indeed come first and he will restore everything.
\v 12 And I tell you that Elijah has come already and they did not recognise him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way the Son of Man is also about to suffer under them.”
\v 13 Then the disciples realised that he was speaking to them about John the Baptiser.
\p
\v 14 When they reached the crowd a man approached him, kneeling in front of him
\v 15 and saying, “Lord, have pity on my son because he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
\v 16 So I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.”
\p
\v 17 In reply Jesus said, “Faithless and perverse generation! How much longer shall I be with you? How much longer shall I suffer you? Bring him here to me.”
\v 18 When Jesus rebuked it the demon left him, and the boy was healed from that moment.
\p
\v 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why were we not able to cast it out?”
\p
\v 20 Jesus said to them, “Because of your lack of faith. For truly I tell you that if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.
\v 21 But this sort does not leave except by prayer and fasting.”
\p
\v 22 While they were going about throughout Galilee Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into human hands
\v 23 and they will kill him; but on the third day he will be raised up.” And they were greatly distressed.
\p 
\v 24 When they arrived in Capernaum, the temple tax collectors\f 17:24 \ft Literally, ‘The two-drachma collectors’ \f* approached Peter and said, “Your teacher – does he not pay the two drachmas?”
\v 25 He replied, “Certainly.”
\p Then, on entering the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? The kings of the earth – from whom do they receive tolls or tribute? From their children or from strangers?”
\p
\v 26 Peter told him, “From strangers.”
\p Jesus declared, “Indeed! The children are exempt.
\v 27 But in order not to offend them, go to the sea, cast a line, and take the first fish that comes up. Then open its mouth and you will find a stater.\f 17:27 \ft At that time, a four-drachma silver coin. \f* Take it, and give it to them on behalf of me and you.”
\p
\c 18
\v 1 At that time the disciples approached Jesus, asking, “So who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?”
\v 2 And Jesus called a small child forward and set him in the middle of them.
\v 3 Then he said, “Truly I tell you that unless you revert and become like little children, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 4 For it is those who make themselves humble – like this small child – who are greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 5 And whoever welcomes one such child in my name, welcomes me.
\v 6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble into sin – it would be better for that person to have a great millstone hung around the neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
\p
\v 7 Woe [comes upon] the world from the snares of sin. Snares are bound to appear, but alas for that person by whom the snare is set.
\v 8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble into sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed than having two hands and two feet to be thrown into everlasting fire.
\v 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble into sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than having two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.
\v 10 See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven are always watching the face of my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 11 For the Son of Man has come to save the lost.
\p
\v 12 What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders off, does he not leave the ninety-nine, go up into the hills and search for the one that has wandered off?
\v 13 And if he does finds it? Truly I tell you, he is happier about that one than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
\v 14 In the same way, it is not acceptable in the sight of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
\p
\v 15 If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault – between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother.
\v 16 But if he does not listen, take with you one or two others so that in the face of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
\v 17 If he does not listen to them, tell it to the Church; and if he does not listen to the Church either, let him be to you just like the heathen or the tax collector.
\v 18 Truly I tell you that whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
\v 19 Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything, whatever they might ask shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where there are two or three gathered in my name, there I am among them.”
\p
\v 21 Then Peter, approaching him, said, “Lord, how many times must my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?”
\p
\v 22 Jesus told him, “I am not saying as many as seven times – but as many as seventy times seven.
\v 23 In this way the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man, a king, who wanted to settle up with his servants.
\v 24 When he began to settle up someone was brought in who owed ten thousand talents,
\v 25 and as he had nothing [with which] to pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and everything he had, so payment could be made.
\v 26 Then, falling down, the servant prostrated himself before him, saying, ‘Lord, be patient with me and I will pay you everything.’
\v 27 That servant’s lord, moved with compassion, let him go free and discharged his debt.
\p
\v 28 Now, on leaving, that servant found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii and, grabbing hold, he began to throttle him, saying, ‘Pay me whatever you owe.’
\p
\v 29 So his fellow servant fell at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will repay you.’
\v 30 But he would not. Indeed, he went off and threw him in prison until he should pay what was owing.
\v 31 His fellow servants, seeing what had happened, were greatly distressed and went and explained to the lord himself everything that had taken place.
\v 32 Then, summoning him, he told him, ‘Evil servant! I discharged the whole of your debt because you begged me.
\v 33 Ought you not to have had mercy on your fellow servant as well, just as I had mercy on you?’
\v 34 Then, exasperated, his lord handed him over to the tormentors until he should pay all that was owed him.
\v 35 So also will my Father in heaven do to you if you do not, each of you, forgive your brother or sister’s transgressions from your heart.”
\p
\c 19
\v 1 When Jesus had finished saying these things he left Galilee and went to the borderlands of Judea beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 Great crowds followed him and he healed them there.
\p
\v 3 The Pharisees approached him to test him, asking him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
\p
\v 4 Replying, he said to them, “Have you not read that he who did the creating in the beginning made them male and female?\rq Genesis 1:27\rq*
\v 5 He said, ‘This is why a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.’\rq Genesis 2:24\rq*
\v 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has put together, let no human being take apart.”
\p
\v 7 They asked him, “Why then did Moses command that a certificate of divorce be given and to send her away?”
\p
\v 8 He told them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but in the beginning it was not like this.
\v 9 I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery; and he who marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.”
\p
\v 10 His disciples said to him, “If that is the situation with man and wife it is better not to marry!”
\p
\v 11 But he said to them, “Not everyone accepts this saying – only those to whom it has been given.
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were born like that from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let the one who is able to accept [this], accept [it].”
\p
\v 13 Then young children were brought to him, so that he might lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples forbade them.
\v 14 Jesus said, “Allow the children to come to me and do not forbid them, for the Kingdom of Heaven is for such as these.”
\v 15 And having laid his hands on them, he left that place.
\p
\v 16 Then, look! – someone approaches and asks him, “Good teacher, what good shall I do so that I might have everlasting life?”
\p
\v 17 He said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except One – God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
\p
\v 18 He asked him, “Which ones?”
\p Jesus replied, “You shall not commit murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness;
\v 19 honour father and mother; and you shall love your neighbour as yourself.”\rq Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20; Leviticus 19:18\rq*
\p
\v 20 The young man said to him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?”
\p
\v 21 Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then, come, follow me.”
\v 22 But when the young man heard these words, he went away sorrowful because he had many possessions.
\v 23 Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I tell you that the rich shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.
\v 24 Again, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the Kingdom of God.”
\p
\v 25 His disciples, listening, were utterly bewildered and said, “Who, then, can be saved?”
\p
\v 26 Jesus, looking straight at them,  answered, “For human beings this is impossible, but for God everything is possible.”
\p
\v 27 Then Peter said to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you. What will there be for us?”
\p
\v 28 Jesus told them, “Truly I tell you that in the ‘new beginning’ when the Son of Man sits on his throne of glory, you who have followed me shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name’s sake will receive a hundred times [more], and shall inherit everlasting life.
\v 30 But many who are first will be last; and those who are last, first.”
\p
\c 20
\v 1 “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a property owner who went out at daybreak to hire labourers for his vineyard.
\v 2 Then, having agreed with the labourers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\v 3 He went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
\v 4 and to them he said, ‘You too – go to the vineyard and I will give you what is right.’
\v 5 And off they went. Then again about the sixth and the ninth hour he went out and did the same.
\v 6 About the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle. He asked them, ‘Why have you stood here idle the whole day?’
\p
\v 7 They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’
\p He told them, ‘You too – go to the vineyard and you will receive what is right.’
\v 8 At nightfall the master of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the labourers and pay them the wages beginning from the last to the first.’
\p
\v 9 Now when those [hired] from about the eleventh hour came forward they each received a denarius.
\v 10 So when the first came forward they supposed that they would receive more, but they also each received a denarius.
\v 11 As they took it they were grumbling against the property owner
\v 12 saying, ‘These last ones have worked one hour, yet you have made them equal with us who have been enduring the burden of the day and the fierce heat.’
\p
\v 13 But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree a denarius with me?
\v 14 Take what is yours and leave. I want to give to this last one as [I gave] to you.
\v 15 Am I not allowed to do what I want with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’
\v 16 So the last shall be first and the first last. For many are called but few are chosen.”
\p
\v 17 Then, on the road as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve disciples aside privately and said to them,
\v 18 “Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be given up to the chief priests and the scribes and they will condemn him to death;
\v 19 and they will hand him over to the Gentiles for them to mock and flog and crucify. And on the third day he will rise again.”
\p
\v 20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons, bowing down and begging him for something.
\v 21 So he said to her, “What do you want?”
\p She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right and one on your left, in your Kingdom.”
\p
\v 22 But Jesus said in reply, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with?”
\p They said to him, “We are able.”
\p
\v 23 So he told them, “You shall indeed drink from my cup and be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with, but to sit on my right and on my left is not mine to give, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”
\p
\v 24 When the [other] ten heard they were extremely annoyed with the two brothers.
\p
\v 25 But Jesus called them close and said, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and those who are powerful wield authority over them?
\v 26 It shall not be like that among you, for whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant,
\v 27 and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave;
\v 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give up his life, a ransom for many.”
\p
\v 29 Then, as they were leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
\v 30 Then, look! – two who are blind are sitting by the road, and hearing that Jesus is passing by they are shoutind out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you Son of David.”
\v 31 Now the crowd ordered them to be quiet, but the blind people shouted out even more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, you Son of David.”
\p
\v 32 Stopping, Jesus called them and said, “What do you want me to do for you?”
\p
\v 33 They said to him, “Lord, that our eyes might be opened.”
\p
\v 34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes and immediately their eyes regained their sight. And they followed him.
\p
\c 21
\v 1 When they were approaching Jerusalem and had reached Bethsphage, near the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent off two disciples
\v 2 telling them, “Go into the village in front of you and immediately you will find a tethered donkey and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me,
\v 3 and if anyone should say anything to you, you are to say, ‘The Lord has a use for them’ and they will send them at once.”
\p
\v 4 All this happened so that what had been spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled,
\q1
\v 5 ‘Tell the daughter of Zion,
\q1 “Behold! Your King is coming to you,
\q1 humble, and sitting on a donkey
\q1 and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.”’\rq Zechariah 9:9\rq*
\m
\v 6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had asked them.
\v 7 They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their cloaks on them, and set [Jesus] upon them.
\v 8 A very large crowd spread their own cloaks on the road while others were cutting fronds from the trees and spreading them on the road.
\v 9 The crowds leading and those following were calling out, saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.”\rq Psalms 117[118]:26\rq*
\p
\v 10 And on his entrance into Jerusalem the entire city went wild saying, “Who is this?”
\v 11 And the crowds responded, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
\p
\v 12 Then Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple and overturned the tables of the money changers and the stalls of those selling doves.
\v 13 And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’\rq Isaiah 56:7; Jeremiah 7:11\rq* but you have made it a den of thieves.”
\p
\v 14 Then the lame and the blind came to him in the temple and he healed them.
\v 15 The chief priests and the scribes, seeing the miracles he was doing and the children calling out in the temple and saying “Hosanna to the son of David” were indignant.
\v 16 So they asked him, “Can you hear what these [children] are saying?”
\p Jesus said, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘From the mouth of babies and infants at the breast you are furnished with praise?’\rq Psalms 8:2\rq*”
\p
\v 17 Abandoning them, he left the city for Bethany and spent the night there.
\p
\v 18 In the morning, returning to the city, he was hungry;
\v 19 and seeing a fig tree by the road he went up to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, “Let there never again be any fruit from you.”
\p And immediately the fig tree withered away.
\v 20 When the disciples saw it they marvelled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither away so soon?”
\p
\v 21 Jesus answered them, “Truly I tell you that if you have faith and do not doubt, you shall not only do this to the fig tree, but even if you were to say to that mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it would be done.
\v 22 And everything – however much – you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”
\p
\v 23 When he had entered the temple, as he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him saying, “By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?”
\p
\v 24 Jesus, responding, said to them, “I, too, will ask you one question; and if you answer me, I, too, will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
\v 25 The baptism of John: from where did it come – from heaven or of human origin?”
\p They debated among themselves saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
\v 26 But if we say, ‘Of human origin…’ We are afraid of the crowd because everyone considers John to be a prophet.”
\v 27 So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.”
\p Then he replied. He said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”
\p
\v 28 “But what do you think? There was a man who had two children. He went to the first and said, ‘My child, go and work in my vineyard today.’
\v 29 The child answered, ‘I will not!’ but afterwards regretted it and went.
\v 30 Going to the second he said the same thing, and that one answered, ‘Yes, sir!’ but did not go.
\v 31 Which of the two did what the father wanted?”
\p They answered him, “The first.”
\p Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the Kingdom of God,
\v 32 for John came to you on the highway of righteousness and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. Even after seeing this you did not repent and believe him.
\p
\v 33 Listen to another parable. There was a man, the master of a house, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a wine vat in it and built a tower and let it to vine-growers and went abroad.
\v 34 When the fruit season drew near he sent his servants to the vine-growers to collect his fruit.
\v 35 But the vine-growers seized his servants; one they beat up, one they killed and one they stoned.
\v 36 Again he sent other servants, more than at first, and they treated them in the same way.
\v 37 Then, last of all, he sent his son to them saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
\v 38 But the vine-growers, seeing the son, said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come! Let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance.’
\v 39 So, seizing him, they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
\v 40 Now when the lord of the vineyard returns what will he do to those vine-growers?”
\p
\v 41 They said to him, “Wretched men! He will bring them to a wretched end and he will let out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons.”
\p
\v 42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures,
\q1 ‘A stone which the builders rejected, that one has become the chief cornerstone.
\q1 This is the Lord’s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.’\rq Psalms 117[118]:22-23\rq*
\m
\v 43 For this reason I tell you that the Kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people producing its fruit.
\v 44 Whoever falls over that stone will be dashed to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be ground to dust.”
\p
\v 45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables they knew he was speaking about them.
\v 46 Though they wanted to seize him they were afraid of the crowds, because they considered him to be a prophet.
\p
\c 22
\v 1 In response, Jesus spoke to them once more in parables, saying,
\v 2 “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man, a king, who was making wedding plans for his son.
\v 3 And he sent out his servants to summon those who were invited to the marriage celebrations, but they were not willing to come.
\v 4 Again, he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Listen, I have prepared my breakfast; my bullocks and my fatstock have been slaughtered and everything is ready. Come to the marriage celebrations.”’
\v 5 But they made light of it and went off – one to his own farm, another to his business,
\v 6 and the rest seized his servants, abused them and killed them.
\v 7 When that king heard he was angry and, dispatching his soldiers, he slew those murderers and burnt their city.
\p
\v 8 Then he said to his servants, ‘The marriage feast is indeed ready, but those invited were not worthy.
\v 9 So go out to the street-corners and invite to the marriage celebrations whoever you can find.’
\v 10 Then those servants, going out onto the streets, gathered up everyone they found – both good and bad – and the marriage feast was filled with guests.
\v 11 The king, coming in to see the guests, saw there a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes.
\v 12 He asked him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here not dressed in wedding clothes?’ And he was speechless.
\v 13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot. Take him away and throw him into the outer darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
\v 14 Because many are invited but few are chosen.”
\p
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went away and discussed how they might catch him out in what he said.
\v 16 They sent their own disciples to him with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God truthfully and pay no attention to anyone because you do not go by appearances.
\v 17 Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?”
\p
\v 18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why do you test me? Hypocrites!
\v 19 Show me the tribute money.”
\p They brought him a denarius.
\p
\v 20 He asked them, “This image. Whose is it? And the inscription?”
\p
\v 21 They said, “Caesar’s.”
\p Then he said to them, “So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
\p
\v 22 Hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving him, they went away.
\p
\v 23 On that day Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and questioned him.
\v 24 They said, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If someone dies without having children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’
\v 25 Now there were with us seven brothers and the first married and died and, having no offspring, left his wife to his brother.
\v 26 In the same way, the second also, and the third – and on to the seventh.
\v 27 Last of all the woman also died.
\v 28 So, at the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be the wife? For all had her.”
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus answered them, “You are misled, knowing neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.
\v 30 For at the resurrection people neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.
\v 31 But about the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God? He said,
\v 32 ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’\rq Exodus 3:6\rq* God is not a God of the dead, but of the living.”
\p
\v 33 When the crowds heard it they were astonished at his teaching.
\v 34 And the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered around him.
\p
\v 35 One of them, a lawyer, questioned him, testing him, saying,
\v 36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment of the law?”
\p
\v 37 Jesus told him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’\rq Deuteronomy 6:5\rq*
\v 38 This is the first and great commandment.
\v 39 The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’\rq Leviticus 19:18\rq*
\v 40 On these two commandments the entire law and the prophets depend.”
\p
\v 41 Now, while the Pharisees were gathered, Jesus questioned them
\v 42 saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?”
\p They answered, “David’s.”
\p 
\v 43 He said to them, “Then why does David in the Spirit call him ‘Lord’ saying,
\q1
\v 44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand
\q1 until I make your enemies a stool for your feet?’\rq Psalms 109[110]:1\rq*
\m
\v 45 So if David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”
\p
\v 46 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare to ask him anything further.
\p
\c 23
\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
\v 2 saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses
\v 3 so whatever they tell you to observe, observe and fulfil; but do not do as they do, for they talk but do not act.
\v 4 Yes, they lash together burdens, heavy and painful to carry, and set them on people’s shoulders; but they will not move them, [not even] with their finger.
\v 5 Everything they do, they do to be observed by others. That is why they make their phylacteries broad and make much of the fringes of their robes.
\v 6 They love the top table at dinners and the front seats in the synagogues.
\v 7 And the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ by the people.
\v 8 But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi’ for there is one who is your teacher: the Christ; and all of you are brothers and sisters.
\v 9 And do not call anyone on earth your father, for there is one who is your Father: he who is in heaven.
\v 10 And do not be called ‘master’, for there is one who is your master: the Christ.
\v 11 But the greatest among you shall be your servant
\v 12 because those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
\p
\v 13 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you gobble up widows’ houses, and for effect make long prayers. For this reason you will receive a greater condemnation.
\p
\v 14 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut off the Kingdom of Heaven from the sight of the people. For you yourselves do not enter, and you prevent those who would enter from going in.
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you encompass the sea and land to make one convert; and when that happens you make that person twice as much a child of Gehenna as you yourselves.
\p
\v 16 Woe to blind guides! you who say, ‘If someone swears by the sanctuary, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is under obligation.’
\v 17 Blind fools! For which is greater – the gold, or the sanctuary which is sanctifying the gold?
\v 18 And, ‘If someone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it is under obligation.’
\v 19 Blind fools! For which is greater – the gift, or the altar which is sanctifying the gift?
\v 20 So the one who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
\v 21 And the one who swears by the sanctuary, swears by it and by him who resides in it.
\v 22 And the one who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who seated on it.
\p
\v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give tithes of mint and dill and cumin, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law – justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have practised without neglecting the others.
\v 24 Blind guides! Filtering out the gnat and swallowing the camel!
\p
\v 25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.
\v 26 Blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish so that the outside of them might also be clean.
\p
\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which do indeed appear beautiful on the outside, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth.
\v 28 In the same way, you too appear to people righteous on the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and transgression.
\p
\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous ones,
\v 30 and say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have participated with them in [shedding] the blood of the prophets.’
\v 31 Therefore you acknowledge to yourselves that you are children of those who murdered the prophets,
\v 32 and you top up the measure of your ancestors.
\v 33 Snakes! Brood of vipers! How will you escape the damnation of Gehenna?
\v 34 For this reason, listen! – I am sending you prophets and people of wisdom and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify. Some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
\v 35 In this way all the righteous blood being poured out on the earth – from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar – will fall upon you.
\v 36 Truly I tell you that all these things will come upon this generation.
\p
\v 37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Killing the prophets and stoning those sent to you! How often have I longed to gather up your children as a hen gathers her own chicks under her wings; but you were not willing.
\v 38 See? Your house is left to you deserted,
\v 39 for I tell you that you will not see me from now on until you are able to say, ‘Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord.’\rq Psalms 117[118]:26\rq*”
\p
\c 24
\v 1 Jesus left the temple and as he went out his disciples approached and pointed out to him the temple buildings.
\v 2 But he told them, “You see all of this, do you not? Truly I say to you that there will not remain here a stone on a stone that will not be demolished.”
\p
\v 3 When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us when these things will happen and what is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
\p
\v 4 Jesus replied, saying to them, “Watch out that no one leads you astray.
\v 5 For many will come in my name saying, ‘I am the Christ’ and they will lead many astray.
\v 6 Then after that you will hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not frightened, for all of these things must happen; but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 All these things are but the beginning of the birth-pains.
\v 9 Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and they will kill you and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name.
\v 10 And then many will stumble and will betray one another and hate one another.
\v 11 Many false prophets will arise and they will lead many astray.
\v 12 And because lawlessness will increase the love of many will grow cold;
\v 13 The one who perseveres to the end, that is the one who will be saved.”
\p
\v 14 “This Gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed to the whole world as a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.
\p
\v 15 Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation,\rq Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11\rq* which was spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place – let the reader understand –
\v 16 then those who are in Judea, let them flee to the mountains;
\v 17 those who are on the housetop, let them not go down to collect anything from their house;
\v 18 those who are in the field, let them not turn back to pick up their clothes.
\v 19 Pity those who are pregnant and those breast-feeding in those days.
\v 20 Pray that your retreat will not be in winter or a Sabbath,
\v 21 for then there will be great anguish, such as there has not been from the beginning of the world until now and never shall be.
\v 22 And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would have been saved, but, for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.”
\p
\v 23 “Then, if anyone tells you, ‘Look! – here is the Christ!’ or ‘Here!’ do not believe [it]
\v 24 for false christs and false prophets will arise, and they will produce great signs and wonders in order to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.”
\p
\v 25 “Listen, I have told you beforehand,
\v 26 so if they tell you, ‘Look! – he is in the desert’ do not go out; or ‘Look! – in the rooms inside’ do not believe [it].”
\p
\v 27 “For just as the lightning flashes from the east and illuminates as far as the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 28 For wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will be gathered.
\v 29 Immediately after the anguish of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light; and the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be toppled.
\v 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky; and then all the tribes of the earth will beat their breasts, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\v 31 And he will send out his angels with a great blast of a trumpet, and they will gather up his chosen ones from the four winds, from end to end of the heavens.”
\p
\v 32 “From the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch becomes tender and it sprouts leaves you know that summer is near.
\v 33 In the same way, when you see all these things you know that it is near – at the doors.
\v 34 Truly I tell you that this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
\v 35 Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away.
\v 36 As for that day and hour, no one knows – not even the angels of heaven – except my Father alone.”
\p
\v 37 “As in the days of Noah so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 38 For just as they were in the days before the flood – eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah went into the ark,
\v 39 not understanding until the flood came and carried everyone away – so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 40 At that time there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.
\v 41 Two women will be grinding in the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.
\v 42 Be vigilant, therefore, because you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming.
\v 43 But understand this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming he would have been vigilant and not allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 For this reason you too be prepared, for the Son of Man is coming at the hour you are not expecting.”
\p
\v 45 “Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing this when he returns.
\v 47 Truly I tell you that he will set him over all his possessions.
\v 48 But if that wicked servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his return,’
\v 49 and if he starts beating his fellow-servant, and if he is eating and drinking with drunkards,
\v 50 the master of that servant will return on a day he does not expect and at an hour when he is unaware;
\v 51 and he will cut him off, and assign him a place with the hypocrites; and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
\p
\c 25
\v 1 “The Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who, taking their lamps, went out to meet the bridegroom.
\v 2 Five of them were sensible and five were foolish.
\v 3 Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps did not take oil with them.
\v 4 But the sensible ones took with their lamps their flasks of oil.
\v 5 Now because the bridegroom was delayed they all dozed and fell asleep.
\v 6 But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Listen! – the bridegroom is coming! Go out to meet him.’
\v 7 Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
\v 8 The foolish ones said to the sensible ones, ‘Give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.’
\v 9 But the sensible virgins answered, ‘What if there is not enough for us and you? You had better go to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’
\v 10 While they went off to buy the bridegroom appeared, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.
\v 11 Eventually the other virgins also came back, saying, ‘Master, master, open up for us.’
\v 12 But he answered, ‘Truly I tell you I do not know you.’
\v 13 Keep watch, therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour when the Son of Man is coming.
\p
\v 14 For it is like a man going abroad who summoned his own servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
\v 15 To one he gave five talents; and to another, two; and to another, one – to each according to his individual ability – and immediately went abroad.
\v 16 Then the one who had received five talents went off, traded with them, and made another five talents.
\v 17 Similarly, the one who had received the two, he also gained another two.
\v 18 But he who received the one went off, dug in the ground, and hid his master’s money.
\p
\v 19 Now, after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
\v 20 Then the one who had received the five talents, coming forward, brought the other five talents, saying, ‘Master, you entrusted me with five talents; look, in addition to those I have gained another five talents.’
\p
\v 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Share the joy of your master.’
\p
\v 22 Then the one who had received the two talents also came forward. He said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with two talents; look, in addition to those I have gained another two talents.’
\p
\v 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Share the joy of your master.’
\p
\v 24 Then the one who had received one talent also came forward. He said, ‘Master, I know you, that you are a hard man, reaping what you have not sown, and gathering up what you have not threshed.
\v 25 I was afraid. I went away and I hid your talent in the ground. Look, you have what belongs to you.’
\p
\v 26 But his master answered him saying, ‘Wicked and lazy servant! You know that I reap what I have not sown and gather up what I have not threshed!
\v 27 Therefore you should have deposited my money with the bankers and on my return I would have received what was mine with interest.
\v 28 Now then, take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
\v 29 For to those who have it will be given, and they shall have more than enough; but from those who do not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
\v 30 So throw the unprofitable servant into the darkness outside where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”
\p
\v 31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the holy angels with him, then he shall sit on the throne of his glory.
\v 32 All the nations will be gathered together before him and he will separate them one from another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 He will place the sheep on his right hand side and the goats on the left.
\v 34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, blessed ones of my Father, receive the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
\v 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me a drink; I was a stranger and you took me in;
\v 36 naked and you clothed me; I was ill and you visited me; I was in prison and you came to me.’
\p
\v 37 Then the righteous will answer him saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed [you] or thirsty and offer a drink?
\v 38 And when did we see you a stranger and offer hospitality or naked and clothe [you]?
\v 39 And when did we see you ill or in prison and come to you?’
\p
\v 40 Then the King will answer, telling them, ‘Truly I say to you inasmuch as you did it for one of the least of these my brothers and sisters you did it for me.’
\v 41 Then he will also speak to those on his left, ‘Go from me, cursed ones, to the everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
\v 42 For I was hungry and you did not feed me; I was thirsty and you did not give me a drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger and you did not take me in; naked, and you did not clothe me; ill, and in prison, and you did not visit me.’
\p
\v 44 Then they too will answer him saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison and did not minister to you?’
\p
\v 45 Then he will answer them saying, ‘Truly I say to you inasmuch as you did not do it for one of the least of these you did not do it for me.’
\v 46 They will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”
\p
\c 26
\v 1 Now when Jesus had finished saying all these things he told his disciples,
\v 2 “You know that in two days comes the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.”
\p
\v 3 Then the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the High Priest who was called Caiaphas.
\v 4 Together they took council with the intent of taking Jesus by trickery and killing him.
\v 5 But they were saying, “Not during the feast because there might be a riot among the people.”
\p
\v 6 Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper.
\v 7 A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfumed oil, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.
\v 8 But when they saw it, his disciples were indignant and said, “Why this waste?
\v 9 This oil could have been sold for a great amount and given to the poor.”
\p
\v 10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good deed for me.
\v 11 You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.
\v 12 For when she put this oil on my body she did it for my burial.
\v 13 Truly I tell you, wherever this Gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”
\p
\v 14 Then one of the Twelve who was called Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests.
\v 15 He said, “What are you willing to give me if I betray him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty silver pieces.
\v 16 And from that time on he was looking for an opportunity to betray him.
\p
\v 17 On the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples approached Jesus, asking him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
\p
\v 18 He told them to go into the city to a particular person and to tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I want to keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.”’
\v 19 So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover.
\p
\v 20 When evening came he was at the table with the Twelve,
\v 21 and as they were eating he said, “Truly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”
\p
\v 22 Then in great distress they began to ask him in turn, “Perhaps it is I, Lord?”
\p
\v 23 And in reply he said, “One who has dipped his hand with me into the dish, he will betray me.
\v 24 The Son of Man is indeed departing – just as it has been written about him – but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would be better for him if that man had not been born.”
\p
\v 25 Then Judas – the one who betrayed him – responded, saying, “Perhaps it is I, Rabbi?”
\p And Jesus replied, “[It is as] you say.”
\p
\v 26 Now, while they were eating Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and began giving it to his disciples, saying, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
\v 27 Then, taking the cup, he gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, “Drink, all of you,
\v 28 because this is my blood of the new covenant which is being poured out on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins.
\v 29 I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you anew in my Father’s Kingdom.”
\v 30 And after singing [a psalm], they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus told them, “This night you will all stumble because of me, for it is written, ‘I shall strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’\rq Zechariah 13:7\rq*
\v 32 But after I have been raised I shall go before you into Galilee.”
\p
\v 33 In response, Peter said to him, “Everyone might stumble because of you, but I myself will never stumble.”
\p
\v 34 Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you that this night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.”
\p
\v 35 And Peter, answering, said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the disciples said the same.
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus arrived with them at a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit down while I go on further and pray.”
\v 37 Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and distressed.
\v 38 Then Jesus said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Remain here and watch with me.”
\p
\v 39 Going forward a little, he  fell on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not according to my will, but yours.”
\p
\v 40 Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “So you did not have the strength to watch with me for one hour.
\v 41 Watch and pray so that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
\p
\v 42 Again, going away a second time he prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me, but I must drink it, let your will be done.”
\v 43 Returning, he again found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
\v 44 Again he went away and left them and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.
\v 45 Then he went to his disciples and told them, “From now on, sleep and rest. See, the hour is approaching and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Get up! Let us go. Listen! – the one who is betraying me is approaching.”
\p
\v 47 And while he was still speaking, look! – Judas, one of the Twelve, arrives – and with him, a large crowd with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\v 48 The one who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “He is the one whom I shall kiss. Seize him.”
\v 49 And at once he came up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and he kissed him.
\p
\v 50 Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” Then they came up, laid hands on Jesus, and arrested him.
\v 51 Then, look! – one of those with Jesus stretches out his hand, draws his sword and, striking the High Priest’s servant, he takes off his ear.
\v 52 At this, Jesus said to him, “Return your sword to its place, for all who take up the sword shall die by the sword.
\v 53 Do you think that I could not at this moment appeal to my Father who would provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled – that it must happen this way?”
\p
\v 55 At that moment Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and staves, as if against a bandit, to seize me? Every day I was sitting with you, teaching in the Temple, and you did not arrest me.
\v 56 But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.”
\p Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.
\p
\v 57 Those arresting Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the High Priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
\v 58 Peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the High Priest. He went inside and was sitting with the attendants to see the outcome.
\v 59 Now, the chief priests and the elders and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus so they might put him to death,
\v 60 but they did not find [it]. Though many false witnesses came forward they did not find [what they wanted].
\v 61 But afterwards two false witnesses did come forward and said, “This man declared, ‘I am able to throw down the sanctuary of God and to build it up in three days.’”
\p
\v 62 Then the High Priest rose and said to him, “Have you no answer? Of what are these people accusing you?”
\v 63 But Jesus was silent. So in response the High Priest said to him, “I put you on oath under the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
\p
\v 64 Jesus said to him, “[It is as] you say. Nevertheless, I tell you that from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, coming on the clouds of heaven.”
\p
\v 65 Then the High Priest tore his robes, saying, “He has spoken blasphemously! What need have we of further witnesses? Look, you have now heard his blasphemy.
\v 66 What is your opinion?”
\p They answered, “He he deserves to be punished by death.”
\v 67 Then they spat in his face and punched him and some slapped [him],
\v 68 saying, “Hey Christ, reveal to us in advance who has hit you!”
\p
\v 69 Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard and a servant-girl came up to him, saying, “You were with Jesus of Galilee as well.”
\p
\v 70 But he denied it in front of all of them, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.”
\p
\v 71 Then, going into the porch, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, “And this man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
\p
\v 72 And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man.”
\p
\v 73 After a while those standing nearby by came up and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for even your speech gives you away.”
\p
\v 74 Then, he began to curse and to swear, “I do not know the man.”
\p And at once a cock crowed.
\v 75 Then Peter remembered Jesus’ words, that he had said to him, “Before cock crow you will disown me three times.” And, going outside, he wept bitterly.
\p
\c 27
\v 1 Morning came and all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred concerning Jesus with the purpose of putting him to death.
\v 2 Then, having bound him, they led him away and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
\v 3 When Judas – he who had betrayed him – saw that he had been condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and to the elders.
\v 4 He said, “I have sinned, betraying innocent blood.”
\p But they replied, “What [is that] to us? You see [to it].”
\p
\v 5 Then, hurling the silver pieces into the sanctuary, he withdrew, and went off and hanged himself.
\v 6 The chief priests, taking the silver pieces, said, “It is not lawful to put them with the offerings since it is the price of blood.”
\v 7 Having conferred, they used them to buy the Potter’s Field for the burial of foreigners.
\v 8 Therefore, that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
\v 9 What had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled at that time. He said,
\q1 ‘They took the thirty pieces of silver,
\q1 the price of the one whose price had been fixed,
\q1 the one upon whom those of the children of Israel had put a price,
\q1
\v 10 and they gave them for the Potter’s Field,
\q1 as the Lord had instructed me.\rq Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9\rq*
\m
\p
\v 11 Now, Jesus stood before the governor and the governor questioned him, asking, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
\p Jesus told him, “[It is as] you say.”
\p
\v 12 But when he was being charged by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond at all.
\v 13 Pilate then said to him, “Do you not comprehend the magnitude of what they are accusing you?”
\p
\v 14 But Jesus did not repond to him, not a single word, so that the governor was utterly astonished.
\v 15 Now, at the feast the governor had been accustomed to release someone  for the crowd – a prisoner – whoever they wanted.
\v 16 At that time, they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
\v 17 So when they had gathered Pilate asked them, “Who do you want me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus, who is called Christ?”
\v 18 For he realised that it was because of envy that they had given him up.
\p
\v 19 As he was sitting in judgement his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much in a dream today because of him.”
\v 20 Now, the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and kill Jesus.
\v 21 The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?”
\p And they said, “Barabbas.”
\p
\v 22 Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with Jesus, the one called Christ?”
\p They all replied, “Let [him] be crucified!”
\p
\v 23 The governor exclaimed, “Why? What evil has he done?”
\p But they were shouting out more and more, crying, “Crucify!”
\p
\v 24 When Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather a riot was brewing, he took water and washed [his] hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this righteous man’s blood. You see [to it].”
\p
\v 25 And all the people answered, saying, “His blood [be] upon us and upon our children.”
\p
\v 26 Then Pilate released Barabbas for them, and having flogged Jesus he handed him over to be crucified.
\p
\v 27 Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and the whole cohort gathered around him.
\v 28 Having stripped him, they put a scarlet cloak on him;
\v 29 and plaiting a crown out of thorns they set it on his head, and [placed] a reed in his right hand. They knelt before him and began mocking him, saying, “Hail! The king of the Jews!”
\v 30 Spitting at him, they took the reed and began beating him on the head.
\v 31 Then, when they had mocked him, they removed the cloak from him and put on him his own clothes, then led him away to be crucified.
\p
\v 32 On their way out they found a man – a Cyrenean, Simon by name – and conscripted him to carry his cross.
\v 33 When they arrived at a place called Golgotha – that is to say, ‘Skull Place’ –
\v 34 they gave him sour wine mixed with gall to drink, but, having tasted [it], he would not drink.
\v 35 Having crucified him, they divided up his clothing among them, throwing dice.
\v 36 Then, sitting there, they watched him.
\v 37 Above his head they put up his crime in writing, ‘This is Jesus, the King of the Jews’.
\p
\v 38 At that time two thieves were crucified with him – one on the right and one on the left.
\v 39 The passers-by vilified him, shaking their heads
\v 40 and saying, “Temple demolisher and three-day rebuilder! Save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”
\p
\v 41 Similarly the chief priests were jeering as well, with the scribes and elders and Pharisees. They were saying,
\v 42 “Others, he saved. Himself, he cannot save! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross. Then we might believe in him!
\v 43 He trusted in God; now let [God] deliver him – if he wants him – because he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
\v 44 The thieves, too, who were crucified with him were taunting him.
\p
\v 45 From the sixth hour darkness came upon the whole earth until the ninth hour.
\v 46 And at about the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying “Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?” That is, “My God, my God, why have you deserted me?”
\p
\v 47 Hearing [this], some of those standing there said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
\p
\v 48 And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and, filling it with sour wine and putting it on a reed, he and gave [it] to him to drink.
\v 49 But the rest were saying, “Leave [him] alone. Let us see if Elijah does come to save him.”
\p
\v 50 Jesus, again crying out in a loud voice, gave up the spirit.
\v 51 Then, look! – the veil of the sanctuary is torn in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quakes and the rocks are split apart.
\v 52 Then the tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
\v 53 Coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the Holy City and appeared to many.
\v 54 The centurion and those who were with him, guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that had happened, were utterly terrified and said, “In truth, this was God‘s Son.”
\p
\v 55 Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, looking after him, were also there, watching at a distance.
\v 56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
\p
\v 57 When evening came a rich man from Arimathaea arrived, Joseph by name, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
\v 58 This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate gave the order for the body to be released.
\v 59 So, taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in pure fine linen
\v 60 and laid it in his new grave which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a large stone [across] the entrance of the grave and went away.
\v 61 Mary Magdalene was there, with the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
\v 62 On the next day – that is, following the [Day of] Preparation – the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate.
\v 63 They said, “Sir, we recall what that imposter said when he was still alive: ‘After three days I shall be raised.’
\v 64 Therefore, give orders for the tomb be made secure until the third day – because his disciples might come at night and steal him away, and then tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ And this last fraud would be worse than the first.”
\p
\v 65 Pilate told them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you know [how].”
\v 66 So they went off and made the tomb secure with a guard, putting a seal on the stone.
\p
\c 28
\v 1 After the Sabbath, as it was coming light on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went with the other Mary to see the tomb.
\v 2 Then, look! – there is a mighty earthquake, for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, has comes and rolled away the stone from the entrance and is sitting on it.
\v 3 His countenance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow.
\v 4 The guards shook with fear because of him and became like dead men.
\v 5 The angel began to speak and told the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.
\v 6 He is not here because he is risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
\v 7 Then go quickly; tell his disciples, ‘He is risen from the dead, and listen! – he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold! I have told you!”
\p
\v 8 Quickly, they left the tomb in fear and great joy and ran to take the news to his disciples.
\v 9 They were on their way to tell his disciples, when look! – Jesus meets them; he says, “Be glad!”
\p Coming up, they took hold of his feet and worshipped him.
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers and sisters that they should go to Galilee, and there they shall see me.”
\p
\v 11 As they continued on their way, look! – some [soldiers] of the guard reach the city and tell the chief priests everything that has happened.
\v 12 When they had met with the elders to consider the matter they gave the soldiers a considerable sum of money,
\v 13 saying, “Let it be known that, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him while we slept.’
\v 14 And if the governor gets to hear of this, we will pacify him. So you are not to worry.”
\v 15 So they took the money and did as they had been instructed, and this story circulates widely among the Jews to this day.
\p
\v 16 The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them,
\v 17 and on seeing him, they worshipped him, though some hesitated.
\v 18 Then Jesus came close and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
\v 19 Go, make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
\v 20 teaching them to observe everything, whatever I have commanded you. And, behold! I am with you every day until the end of the age.” Amen.
\p
