\v 1 A scroll of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
\p
\v 2 Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
\v 3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.
\v 4 Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
\v 5 Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed was the father of Jesse.
\v 6 Jesse was the father of David the king.
\p David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah.
\v 7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
\v 8 Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah.
\v 9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
\v 10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
\v 11 Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylon exile.
\p
\v 12 After the Babylon exile Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
\v 13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
\v 14 Azor was the father of Sadoc. Sadoc was the father of Achim. Achim was the father of Eliud.
\v 15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
\v 16 Jacob was the father of Joseph. He was the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus who is called Christ.
\p
\v 17 Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the Babylon exile, fourteen generations; and from the Babylon exile until the Christ, fourteen generations.
\p
\v 18 The birth of Jesus Christ was like this. When his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Joseph, her betrothed,\f +\fr 1:19\ft ‘her betrothed’ – The Greek is simply ‘her man’.\f* being a righteous man and not wanting to make an example of her, intended to send her away quietly.
\p
\v 20 As he was considering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ‘Joseph, son of David, you need not be afraid to accept Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 She will bear a son, and you will give him the name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.’
\p
\v 22 All this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled:
\v 23 ‘Listen, a virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him Emmanuel,’\rq Isaiah 7:14\rq* which means, ‘God with us.’
\p
\v 24 Waking from sleep, Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had told him. He accepted his wife,
\v 25 but he did not have intercourse with her until she had given birth to her son, her firstborn, and given him the name Jesus.
\p

\v 1 When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem
\v 2 asking, ‘Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.’
\p
\v 3 When Herod the king heard, he was troubled, and the whole of Jerusalem with him.
\v 4 Assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he enquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
\v 5 They told him, ‘In Bethlehem of Judaea, for so it has been written through the prophet.
\v 6 “And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, you are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for from you shall come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.”’\rq Micah 5:2\rq*
\p
\v 7 Then Herod summoned the magi secretly and enquired of them the exact time of the star’s appearance.
\v 8 Sending them to Bethlehem, he said, ‘Go and search carefully for the young child, and as soon as you have found him, bring me word so that I too may go and worship.’
\p
\v 9 Having listened to the king, they left; and the star which they had seen in the east went on ahead of them until it arrived and stood over where the young child was.
\v 10 When they saw the star they rejoiced with great joy,
\v 11 and entering the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother. They threw themselves down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they presented him with gifts: gold and frankincense and myrrh.
\v 12 Then, having been warned by God in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned home by different road.
\p
\v 13 When they had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, ‘When you wake up, take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt and remain there until I tell you, because Herod is about to search for the child to kill him.’
\p
\v 14 Then Joseph woke up and took the young child and his mother and left by night for Egypt.
\v 15 He was there until the death of Herod so that what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled. He said, ‘Out of Egypt I have called my Son.’\rq Hosea 11:1\rq*
\p
\v 16 When Herod realised that he had been duped by the magi he was extremely angry, and he sent and put to death all the male children of two years and under in Bethlehem and in all its surroundings, corresponding to the time which he had discovered from the magi.
\v 17 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled. He said,
\v 18 ‘A cry was heard in Ramah, lamentation and wailing and great mourning: Rachel weeping for her children, but she would not be comforted because they were no more.’\rq Jeremiah 38[31]:15\rq*
\p
\v 19 When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\v 20 saying, ‘When you wake up, take the young child and his mother and set off for the land of Israel, because those plotting against the child’s life are dead.’
\p
\v 21 When he woke up he took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel,
\v 22 but hearing that Archelaus reigned over Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having being warned by God in a dream, he turned away towards the region of Galilee.
\v 23 When he arrived he settled in a town called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’
\p

\v 1 In those days John the Baptiser appeared, preaching in the Judaean desert.
\v 2 He was saying, ‘Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.’
\v 3 This was because he was the one of whom Isaiah the prophet had spoken, saying, ‘A voice crying out in the wilderness, “Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.”’\rq Isaiah 40:3\rq*
\v 4 Now this man John had for his clothing, camel hair with a leather belt around his waist; and for his food, locusts and wild honey.
\p
\v 5 At that time Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the Jordan countryside were going out to him,
\v 6 and they were being baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
\v 7 When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, ‘Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Well then, produce fruit worthy of repentance,
\v 9 and do not think of saying to yourselves, “We have a father, Abraham,” for I tell you that from these stones God is able to raise up children for Abraham.
\v 10 Even now the axe is laid against the foot of the trees, because every tree that is not producing good fruit is to be felled and thrown into the fire.
\v 11 It is true that I am baptising you with water for repentance, but the one following me is more powerful than I am; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
\v 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand and he will completely clear his threshing floor. Then he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.’
\p
\v 13 At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptised by him.
\v 14 John resisted him, saying, ‘I need to be baptised by you, and yet you come to me.’
\p
\v 15 Replying, Jesus told him, ‘Let it be so for now, for in this way it is fitting for  us to fulfil all righteousness.’ Then John gave way to him.
\p
\v 16 As soon as he was baptised, Jesus rose up from the water and heaven opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and appearing over him.
\v 17 And there was a voice from heaven saying, ‘This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight.’
\p
\c 4
\v 1 At that time Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil,
\v 2 and he fasted for forty days and forty nights. Afterwards he was hungry,
\v 3 and the tempter came to him and said, ‘If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’
\p
\v 4 In reply he said, ‘It is written, “No one shall live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”’\rq Deuteronomy 8:3\rq*
\p
\v 5 Then the devil took him into the holy city and set him upon the pinnacle of the Temple,
\v 6 and he said to him, ‘If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, “He will command his angels concerning you, and upon their hands they will lift you up so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.”’\rq Psalms 90[91]:11-12\rq*
\p
\v 7 Jesus spoke to him once more, ‘It is written, “You shall not tempt the Lord your God.”’\rq Deuteronomy 6:16\rq*
\p
\v 8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world with their glory,
\v 9 and he said to him, ‘All this I shall give to you if you fall down and reverence me.’
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus said to him, ‘Get behind me, Satan, for it is written, “You shall reverence the Lord your God, and you shall worship him alone.”’\rq Deuteronomy 6:13\rq*
\p
\v 11 The devil then left him, and angels came and ministered to him.
\p
\v 12 When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew into Galilee.
\v 13 He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali
\v 14 so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled. He says,
\v 15 ‘Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the sea’s highway beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
\v 16 The people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and for those sitting in the territory and the shadow of death, light has dawned upon them.’\rq Isaiah 9:1-2\rq*
\p
\v 17 From that moment Jesus began to preach and to say, ‘Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven has come close.’
\p
\v 18 Walking beside the sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen;
\v 19 and he said to them, ‘Follow me and I shall make you fish for people.’
\v 20 And at once they left the nets and followed him.
\v 21 He went on from there and saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets; and he called them.
\v 22 At once they left the boat and their father and followed him.
\p
\v 23 All over Galilee Jesus would walk among the people, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness.
\v 24 The news about him spread out into the whole of Syria; and they brought to him all who were ill, afflicted with a variety of diseases and suffering torments, the demon-possessed and the lunatics and the paralysed, and he healed them.
\v 25 Great crowds from Galilee and the Ten Towns and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up onto the mountain. He sat down, and his disciples came to him.
\v 2 Opening his mouth, he began to teach them, saying,
\q1
\v 3 ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit,
\q2 for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\rq Isaiah 57:15; 66:2\rq*
\q1
\v 4 Blessed are those who mourn,
\q2 for they shall be comforted.\rq Isaiah 61:2; 66:10,13\rq*
\q1
\v 5 Blessed are the meek,
\q2 for they shall inherit the earth.\rq Psalms 36[37]:11\rq*
\q1
\v 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
\q2 for they shall be filled.
\q1
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful,
\q2 for they shall be shown mercy.
\q1
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart,
\q2 for they shall see God.
\q1
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers,
\q2 for they shall be called children of God.
\q1
\v 10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,
\q2 for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
\q1
\v 11 Blessed are you when they taunt you and persecute you and falsely accuse you of all kinds of evil because of me.
\q1
\v 12 Rejoice and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven;
\q2 because this is how they persecuted the prophets before you.
\m
\pi
\v 13 ‘You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how is it to become salty again? It is then good for nothing, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
\v 15 Nor do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand so that it gives light to all who are in the house.
\v 16 In the same way, let your light shine before all so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
\pi
\v 17 ‘Do not think that I have come to overthrow the law or the prophets. I have not come to overthrow but to fulfil,
\v 18 for truly I tell you that until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one tiny pen-stroke, shall pass from the law until everything is accomplished.
\v 19 Therefore whoever sets aside one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever keeps them and teaches them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 20 Indeed, I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
\pi
\v 21 ‘You have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not kill”\rq Exodus 20:13\rq* and, “Whoever commits murder will be held liable at the Judgement.”
\v 22 Well I am telling you that everyone who is angry with a brother or sister without reason will be held liable at the Judgement; and whoever says that a brother or sister is worthless will be answerable to the courts; and whoever calls one a fool will be liable to the hell of fire.
\pi
\v 23 ‘If then you are offering your gift at the altar, and there you remember that your brother or sister has something against you,
\v 24 leave your gift there at the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother or sister; then return and offer your gift.
\v 25 Be reconciled quickly with the one taking you to court while you are still together on the way, or else your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer for you to be put in prison.
\v 26 Truly I tell you that you will not get out of there until you have paid the last fraction of a penny.\f +\fr 5:26\ft ‘quadrans’ – a small bronze coin with a value of 1/64th of a denarius.\f*
\pi
\v 27 ‘You have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not commit adultery.”\rq Exodus 20:14\rq*
\v 28 Well I am telling you that anyone looking at a woman, desiring her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
\v 29 If then your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you, for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you, for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
\pi
\v 31 ‘It was also said, “Whoever divorces his wife should give her a certificate of divorce.”\rq Deuteronomy 24:1\rq*
\v 32 Well I am telling you that whoever divorces his wife, except in a case of adultery, forces her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
\pi
\v 33 ‘Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not swear falsely; you shall honour your oaths to the Lord.”
\v 34 Well I am telling you not to swear at all, not by heaven because it is the throne of God,
\v 35 nor by the earth because it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem because it is the city of the Great King.
\v 36 Nor should you swear by your head because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let what you say be yes for yes and no for no, because more than that is from the evil one.
\pi
\v 38 ‘You have heard that it was said, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,”\rq Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21\rq*
\v 39 but I am telling you not to respond to evil. To anyone who slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other one as well.
\v 40 And to anyone who wants to sue you and take your shirt, offer your coat as well.
\v 41 And with anyone who conscripts you to go one mile, go two.
\v 42 Give to the one who begs from you, and do not turn away the one who wants to borrow from you.
\pi
\v 43 ‘You have heard it said that you should love your neighbour and hate your enemy.
\v 44 Well I am telling you to love your enemies, to bless those who curse you, to do good to those who hate you, and to pray for those who slander you and persecute you
\v 45 so that you may be children of your Father in heaven, for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and he sends rain upon the righteous and upon the unrighteous.
\v 46 Because if you love those who love you, what have you earned? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 47 And if you greet only your friends, what extra have you done? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 48 You then are to be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.’
\p
\c 6
\v 1 ‘Be careful not to parade your almsgiving in front of people in order to be seen by them, for then you would have no reward from your Father in heaven.
\v 2 When you give alms you are not to trumpet it in advance as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be honoured by the people. Truly I tell you that they have their reward.
\v 3 But when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
\v 4 so that your almsgiving may be in secret, and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.
\pi
\v 5 ‘And when you pray you are not to be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray in the synagogues and standing on street corners so that they are seen by the people. Truly I tell you that they have their reward.
\v 6 But you, when you pray go into your room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.
\v 7 When you pray do not say things repeatedly like the other nations, for they think that by saying much they will be heard.
\v 8 Do not imitate them because your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
\v 9 But pray like this:
\q1 Our Father who is in heaven,
\q2 hallowed be your name.
\q1
\v 10 Your Kingdom come.
\q1 Your will be done,
\q2 as in heaven, so on the earth.
\q1
\v 11 Give us today our bread,
\q2 sufficient for the day.
\q1
\v 12 And forgive us our debts
\q2 even as we forgive our debtors.
\q1
\v 13 Do not lead us into temptation,
\q2 but deliver us from the evil one.
\q1 For yours is the Kingdom and the power and the glory
\q2 into the ages. Amen.
\m
\pi
\v 14 ‘For if you forgive people their transgressions, your Father who is in heaven will forgive you too;
\v 15 but if you do not forgive people their transgressions, neither will your Father forgive your transgressions.
\pi
\v 16 ‘And when you fast, do not behave like the sour looking hypocrites who disfigure their faces so that they may appear to be fasting. Truly I tell you that they have their reward.
\v 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face
\v 18 so that you may not appear to be fasting except to your Father in secret, and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.
\pi
\v 19 ‘Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,
\v 20 but store up treasures for yourselves in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\pi
\v 22 ‘The lamp of the body is the eye. If then your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light;
\v 23 but if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be full of darkness. And if the light within you is darkness, what darkness is that.
\pi
\v 24 ‘No one is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and the idol of wealth.
\v 25 Because of this, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life: what you are to eat or what you are to drink; nor about your body: what you are to wear. Is life not more than food, and the body than clothing?
\v 26 Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?
\v 27 Who among you by worrying can add one moment\f +\fr 6:27\ft ‘one cubit’ – the length of the forearm.\f* to your life?
\v 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Think carefully about the lilies of the countryside. How do they grow? They do not labour or spin,
\v 29 yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
\v 30 If that is how God clothes the hay in the field which is here today and thrown into the clay oven tomorrow, then all the more you, you of little faith.
\pi
\v 31 ‘Do not be anxious, saying, “What are we to eat?” or, “What are we to drink?” or, “What are we to wear?”
\v 32 The Gentiles do indeed set their sights on all these things, but your Father in heaven knows that you need them all.
\v 33 First set your sights on the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be yours as well.
\v 34 Do not be burdened with care for tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. The day’s own trouble is quite sufficient.’
\p
\c 7
\v 1 ‘Do not judge so that you may not be judged,
\v 2 because you will be judged in the way you that judge others, and the measure you deal out will be dealt to you.
\v 3 How is it that you see the speck in your brother or sister’s eye but do not notice the beam of timber in your own eye?
\v 4 And yet you will say to your brother or sister, “Let me remove the speck from your eye.” But just look at the beam of timber in your own eye.
\v 5 Hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother or sister’s eye.
\pi
\v 6 ‘Do not offer what is holy to dogs; and do not throw your pearls in front of swine, or else they will trample them underfoot and then turn and savage you.
\pi
\v 7 ‘Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find, knock and it will be opened for you.
\v 8 For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and for the one who knocks, it will be opened.
\pi
\v 9 ‘Who among you, if your children ask for bread, will offer them a stone?
\v 10 Or if they ask for a fish, will offer them a snake?
\v 11 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him.
\pi
\v 12 ‘And all that you want others to do for you, you are to do for them as well; for this is the law and the prophets.
\pi
\v 13 ‘Enter by the narrow gate, for the wide gate and the broad road lead to destruction and there are many who go that way.
\v 14 How small the gate, how narrow the road that leads to life, and there are few who find them.
\pi
\v 15 ‘Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but on the inside are predatory wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will recognise them. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 It follows that every good tree produces good fruit, but the rotten tree produces rotten fruit.
\v 18 A good tree cannot produce rotten fruit, nor a rotten tree produce good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree that is not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown on the fire.
\v 20 It is by their fruits that you will recognise them.
\pi
\v 21 ‘Not everyone who addresses me as “Lord, Lord” will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many will tell me on that day, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and performed many miracles in your name?”
\v 23 And then I shall tell them outright, “I never knew you. Leave me, you workers of iniquity.”
\pi
\v 24 ‘Everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house upon a rock.
\v 25 Then the rain came down and the floods came up, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall because it had its foundations on the rock.
\v 26 And everyone who listens to these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a stupid man who built his house on the sand.
\v 27 Then the rain came down and the floods came up, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell. And its fall was catastrophic.’
\p
\v 28 Jesus finished what he was saying, and the crowds were astonished at his teaching
\v 29 because he was teaching them with authority, and not like the scribes.
\p
\c 8
\v 1 He came down from the mountain with large crowds following him.
\v 2 Then a leper arrived. He bowed to him, saying, ‘Lord, if you are willing, you have the power to make me clean.’
\p
\v 3 Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, ‘I am willing. Be made clean,’ and immediately his leprosy was cleaned away.
\v 4 And Jesus said to him, ‘See that you tell no one. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses prescribed as a testimony to them.’
\p
\v 5 When he entered Capernaum, a centurion approached him and pleaded with him.
\v 6 He said, ‘Lord, my servant is lying paralysed at home, in terrible pain.’
\p
\v 7 Jesus told him, ‘I shall come and heal him.’
\p
\v 8 But in reply the centurion declared, ‘Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof, but only say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I am also a man under authority and have soldiers under me; and I say to this one, “Go” and he goes, and to another, “Come” and he comes, and to my slave, “Do this” and he does it.’
\p
\v 10 On hearing this, Jesus was astonished and he said to those who were following, ‘Truly I tell you that not even in Israel have I found such great faith.
\v 11 And I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west and dine with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,
\v 12 but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into utter darkness where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.’
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, ‘Go. Let it be done for you as you have believed.’ And his servant was healed at that instant.
\p
\v 14 When Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw that his mother-in-law was lying down and had a fever.
\v 15 He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began serving him.
\p
\v 16 When evening came they brought to him many who were possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were diseased.
\v 17 In this way what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled: ‘He accepted our infirmities and bore our sufferings.’\rq Isaiah 53:4\rq*
\p
\v 18 Jesus, seeing great crowds around him, gave the order to leave for the opposite shore.
\v 19 Then a solitary scribe came up and said to him, ‘Teacher, I shall follow you wherever you go.’
\p
\v 20 But Jesus told him, ‘Foxes have dens and the birds of the air have places to roost, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’
\p
\v 21 Another of his disciples said to him, ‘Lord, first let me go and bury my father.’
\p
\v 22 But Jesus told him, ‘Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.’
\p
\v 23 He got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
\v 24 Then a great storm fell upon the sea with the result that the boat was being swamped by the waves. But he was sleeping.
\v 25 His disciples went to him and woke him, saying, ‘Lord, save us! We are perishing.’
\p
\v 26 But he said to them, ‘Why are you afraid, you of little faith?’
\p Then he stood up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great stillness.
\v 27 They all marvelled, saying, ‘What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?’
\p
\v 28 When he reached the opposite shore, the land of the Gergesenes, two who were demon-possessed met him, coming out from among the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
\v 29 Then they shouted out, saying, ‘What are we to you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here before the proper time to torment us?’
\p
\v 30 Now at some distance from them there was a herd of many pigs, feeding.
\v 31 The demons pleaded with him, saying, ‘If you cast us out, let us to go away into the herd of pigs.’
\p
\v 32 And he said to them, ‘Go.’ Then the demons departed and entered the herd of pigs, and the whole herd of pigs rushed over the cliff into the sea and perished in the waters.
\p
\v 33 The herdsmen fled. They went into the town and reported it, and everything concerning the demon-possessed.
\v 34 Then the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him they begged him to leave their shores.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived in his home town.
\v 2 They brought to him someone lying on a bed, paralysed. Jesus saw their faith and he said to him, ‘Courage, child; your sins have been forgiven.’
\v 3 Some of the scribes said to themselves, ‘This man is blaspheming.’
\p
\v 4 But Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, ‘Why are you turning over in your minds what is evil?
\v 5 Which is easier: to say, “Your sins have been forgiven,” or to say, “Get up and walk”?
\v 6 But so that you may understand that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,’ he said to the one who was paralysed, ‘Stand up, pick up your bed and go home.’
\v 7 And getting up, he went home.
\v 8 The crowds, seeing this, were astonished; and they glorified God who had given such authority to human beings.
\p
\v 9 As Jesus passed on from there he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, ‘Follow me.’ And he got up and followed him.
\p
\v 10 He was at home, sitting down to eat, and many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting down with Jesus and his disciples.
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw this they said to his disciples, ‘Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?’
\p
\v 12 Jesus heard, and told them, ‘The healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.
\v 13 Now go away and learn what this means: “I desire mercy and not sacrifice.”\rq Hosea 6:6\rq* For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.’
\p
\v 14 Then John’s disciples came to him asking, ‘Why do we and the Pharisees fast a lot, but your disciples do not fast?’
\p
\v 15 And Jesus said to them, ‘Can the groomsmen grieve while the bridegroom is with them? But the day will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast.
\pi
\v 16 ‘No one attaches a piece of unshrunk cloth to an old garment, because when it shrinks it pulls away from the garment and a worse tear is made.
\v 17 Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins in case the skins burst, and then the wine pours out and the skins are destroyed. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.’
\p
\v 18 He was telling them these things when a ruler came up. He bowed to him and said, ‘My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and she will live.’
\v 19 And setting off, Jesus followed him with his disciples.
\p
\v 20 Then a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the hem of his cloak,
\v 21 for she was saying to herself, ‘If I only touch his cloak I shall be healed.’
\p
\v 22 Jesus turned around and saw her and said, ‘Courage, daughter. Your faith has healed you.’ And the woman was healed from that moment.
\p
\v 23 Arriving at the ruler’s house, Jesus saw the flute players and the crowd in uproar.
\v 24 He told them, ‘Get out. The girl has not died, but is sleeping.’ And they laughed at him.
\v 25 But when the crowd had been driven out he went in, took hold of her hand, and the little girl was raised up.
\v 26 The news of this spread throughout the land.
\p
\v 27 As Jesus passed on from there, two blind people followed him, calling out and saying, ‘Have mercy on us, Son of David.’
\p
\v 28 When he reached the house they came up to him, and Jesus asked them, ‘Do you believe that I am able do this?’
\p
\p They said to him, ‘Yes, Lord.’
\p
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‘Because of your faith, let it be done for you.’
\v 30 And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them, saying, ‘See that no one knows.’
\v 31 But when they left, they publicised it throughout that district.
\p
\v 32 Then, as they were leaving, they brought to him someone unable to speak, possessed by a demon.
\v 33 But when the demon had been cast out the one who could not speak began speaking, and the crowd marvelled, saying, ‘Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.’
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, ‘He casts out demons by the prince of demons.’
\p
\v 35 Now Jesus was travelling all around the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and all kinds of infirmity among the people.
\v 36 On seeing the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them because they were lost and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
\v 37 He said to his disciples, ‘Yes, the harvest is plentiful but the labourers are too few,
\v 38 so pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest.’
\p
\c 10
\v 1 He called together his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and illness.
\p
\v 2 These are the names of the Twelve Apostles. First Simon who is called Peter, his brother Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, his brother John,
\v 3 Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Lebbaeus who is called Thaddaeus,
\v 4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him.
\p
\v 5 These twelve Jesus sent out, giving them this instruction: ‘Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
\v 6 Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 As you go, preach and say, “The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”
\v 8 Heal the sick, make the lepers clean, raise the dead, and cast out demons. You have received freely, give freely.
\v 9 Do not make provision for yourselves with gold, silver or copper in your money belts,
\v 10 nor a bag for the journey, or two coats, or shoes or a staff, for the worker deserves the necessities of life.
\v 11 When you enter any town or village, find out who is of good repute and stay there until you move on.
\v 12 As you go into the house, greet it, saying, “Peace to this house”.
\v 13 If the house is worthy, let your peace rest upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
\v 14 And wherever they do not welcome you or listen to what you say, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town.
\v 15 Truly I tell you that on the Day of Judgement it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
\pi
\v 16 ‘Listen, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
\v 17 And be wary of the people, for they will hand you over to sanhedrins and they will flog you in their synagogues.
\v 18 And for my sake you will be brought before governors and kings as a testimony to them and to the nations.
\v 19 But when they do hand you over, do not worry about how or what you will say, for what you say will be given to you at that time.
\v 20 Because it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
\pi
\v 21 ‘Brother will betray brother to death, and a father a child. Children will rise up against parents and put them to death,
\v 22 and you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
\v 23 When they persecute you in this town, flee to another. And I tell you truly that you will not have reached the end of the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
\pi
\v 24 ‘A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above the master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciples to become like the teacher, and the servant like the master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzeboul, how much more those of his household.
\v 26 Do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered up that will not be exposed, and nothing hidden that will not become known.
\v 27 What I am telling you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim from the housetops.
\v 28 And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\pi
\v 29 ‘Are not two sparrows sold for a penny\f +\fr 10:29\ft ‘assarius’ or ‘as’ – a small coin with a value of 1/16th of a denarius.\f*? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father being present.
\v 30 As for you, even the hairs of your head are all counted.
\v 31 Therefore do not be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
\v 32 Everyone who acknowledges me in the presence of others, I too will acknowledge in the presence of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever disowns me in the presence of others, I too will disown in the presence of my Father who is in heaven.
\pi
\v 34 ‘Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace on the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
\v 35 For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\v 36 Yes, one’s enemies are those of one’s own household.
\pi
\v 37 ‘Those who love father or mother more than me are not worthy of me; and those who love son or daughter more than me are not worthy of me.
\v 38 Those who do not accept their cross and follow after me are not worthy of me.
\v 39 Those who have found their life will lose it; and those who have lost their life for my sake will find it.
\v 40 Those who welcome you, welcome me; and those who welcome me, welcome him who sent me.
\v 41 Those who welcome a prophet for being a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. Those who welcome a righteous person for being righteous will receive a righteous person’s reward.
\v 42 And those who give one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink for being a disciple, truly I tell you that they will not lose their reward.’
\p
\c 11
\v 1 When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he moved on from there to teach and to preach in their towns.
\p
\v 2 Now John, hearing in prison what the Christ was doing, sent two of his disciples
\v 3 to ask him, ‘Are you the one who is coming or are we to look for someone else?’
\p
\v 4 And in reply Jesus told them, ‘Go and report to John what you are hearing and seeing:
\v 5 the blind are recovering their sight and the lame are walking; lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing; the dead are being raised and the poor are being brought the Gospel.
\v 6 And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.’
\p
\v 7 As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. ‘What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 8 No? What did you go out to see? A man dressed in elegant clothing? Listen, those who wear elegant clothes are in royal palaces.
\v 9 No? What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet
\v 10 because he is the one of whom it is written, “Listen, I am sending my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way before you.”\rq Malachi 3:1\rq*
\pi
\v 11 ‘Truly I tell you, there has not arisen among those born of women anyone greater than John the Baptiser, yet the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is.
\v 12 From the days of John the Baptiser until now the Kingdom of Heaven continues to suffer violence, and the violent are plundering it by force.
\v 13 All the prophets and the Law prophesied until John;
\v 14 and if you will accept it, he is Elijah whose coming was expected.
\v 15 Let those who have ears for listening, listen.
\pi
\v 16 ‘To what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to their friends
\v 17 and saying, “We piped for you but you did not dance. We sang a lament for you but you did not beat your breast.”
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, “He has a demon.”
\v 19 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and they say, “Look at the man – a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.” But Wisdom is vindicated by her children.’
\p
\v 20 Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had occurred, because they had not repented.
\v 21 ‘Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that have taken place in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and sitting in ashes.
\v 22 Not only that, I am telling you that it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the Day of Judgement than for you.
\v 23 And you, Capernaum, would you be raised all the way up to heaven? You will be thrust down to Hades, for if the miracles that have taken place in you had happened in Sodom, it would have remained to the present day.
\v 24 Not only that, I am telling you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the Day of Judgement than for you.’
\p
\v 25 Speaking at that time, Jesus said, ‘I acknowledge before you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.
\v 26 Yes, Father, for this was your delight.
\pi
\v 27 ‘Everything has been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.
\pi
\v 28 ‘Come to me all you who labour and are overburdened and I shall give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me because I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke sits easily, and my burden is light.’
\p
\c 12
\v 1 On that occasion Jesus made his way through the cornfields on the Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.
\p
\v 2 When the Pharisees noticed, they said to him, ‘Look at your disciples! They are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.’
\p
\v 3 But he told them, ‘Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those with him?
\v 4 How he went into the house of God and ate the shewbread which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the priests?\rq 1 Kingdoms[1 Samuel] 21:3-6\rq*
\v 5 Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the Temple violate the Sabbath yet bear no guilt?
\v 6 I tell you that something greater than the Temple is here.
\v 7 If you had understood this: “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,”\rq Hosea 6:6\rq* you would not have condemned the innocent,
\v 8 for the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.’
\p
\v 9 Then, moving on from there, he went into their synagogue.
\v 10 A man with a withered hand was there, and in order to bring an accusation against him, they questioned him, asking, ‘Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?’
\p
\v 11 He said to them, ‘Which of you has a sheep? If it were to fall into a ditch on the Sabbath, would you not grab hold of it and lift it out?
\v 12 Surely a person is much more valuable than a sheep. Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.’
\v 13 Then he told the man, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ He stretched it out and it was restored to health, just like the other.
\p
\v 14 The Pharisees went outside and conspired against him, about how they might kill him.
\v 15 But Jesus knew. He left that place with great crowds following him, and he healed them all.
\v 16 He told them not to make him known,
\v 17 so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled:
\v 18 ‘You see my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I shall put my Spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
\v 19 He will not rampage or roar, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
\v 20 A bruised reed he will not break, a smouldering wick he will not snuff out, until he has driven justice to victory.
\v 21 And in his name the nations will hope.’\rq Isaiah 42:1-4\rq*
\p
\v 22 Then a man, demon-possessed, blind and unable to speak was brought to him. He healed him so that the man who was blind and unable to speak both spoke and saw,
\v 23 and the crowds were astounded. They were saying, ‘Surely this is the Christ, the Son of David.’
\p
\v 24 On hearing this, the Pharisees said, ‘It is only by Beelzeboul, Prince of Demons, that this man is casting out demons.’
\p
\v 25 But Jesus knew what they were thinking and told them, ‘Every kingdom divided against itself is left in ruins; and no city or household divided against itself will survive.
\v 26 And if Satan is casting out Satan, he is divided against himself, so how will his kingdom survive?
\v 27 And if I am casting out demons by Beelzeboul, by whom are your own people casting them out? In this matter they shall be your judges.
\v 28 But if I am casting out demons by the Spirit of God, then you may be sure that the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 How can someone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he will be able to plunder his house.
\pi
\v 30 ‘Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever is not gathering with me is scattering.
\v 31 For this reason I tell you that every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 32 Whoever says something against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, not in the present age nor in the one that is coming.
\pi
\v 33 ‘Either grow a good tree and its fruit will be good, or grow a rotten tree and its fruit will be rotten, for a tree is recognised by its fruit.
\v 34 Brood of vipers! How can you, who are evil, say anything good? For the mouth speaks what overflows from the heart.
\v 35 A good person comes out with good things from a store of goodness, and an evil person comes out with evil things from a store of evil.
\v 36 I tell you that for every idle word people may say, they will settle an account for it on the Day of Judgement.
\v 37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.’
\p
\v 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke up, saying, ‘Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.’
\p
\v 39 But he responded by telling them, ‘An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
\v 40 For just as the prophet Jonah was in the stomach of the sea monster for three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the bowels of the earth for three days and three nights.
\v 41 Men of Nineveh will stand up at the Judgement with this generation, and they will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and you see here someone greater than Jonah.
\v 42 The Queen of the South will stand up at the Judgement with this generation, and she will condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and you see here someone greater than Solomon.
\pi
\v 43 ‘When an unclean spirit has left a person it wanders through waterless places seeking respite, but it finds none.
\v 44 Then it says, “I shall go back home from where I came.” And when it arrives it finds it vacant and swept clean and decorated.
\v 45 It then sets off and teams up with seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there; and that person ends up worse off than at the beginning. That is also how it will be for this evil generation.’
\p
\v 46 He was still talking to the crowds, but his mother and his brothers had stayed outside, wanting to speak to him.
\v 47 Someone told him, ‘Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.’
\p
\v 48 And in reply he asked the speaker, ‘Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?’
\v 49 Then, stretching out his hand towards his disciples, he declared, ‘You see my mother and my brothers.
\v 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’
\p
\c 13
\v 1 On that day Jesus left the house and sat beside the sea,
\v 2 but they gathered around him in such numbers that he got into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd remained on the shore.
\v 3 Then he told them many things in parables.
\p He said, ‘Listen. A sower went out to sow
\v 4 and, as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside and the birds came and ate them.
\v 5 Others fell on stony ground where they had little soil. They sprouted immediately because they had no depth of earth,
\v 6 but when the sun came up they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered.
\v 7 Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
\v 8 Others fell into good soil and produced grain: some a hundred times over, and some sixty, and some thirty.
\v 9 Let those who have ears for listening, listen.’
\p
\v 10 Then the disciples came up to him and asked, ‘Why are you speaking to them in parables?’
\p
\v 11 In reply he told them, ‘To you it has been granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it has not been granted.
\v 12 For to those who have, it will be given and they will have more than enough, but from those who do not have, even what they have will be taken away.
\v 13 That is why I am speaking to them in parables, so that when they look they may not see, and when they listen they may not hear or understand or ever repent.
\v 14 And then Isaiah’s prophecy for them will be fulfilled. It says, “When listening, you will hear but you will not understand; when looking, you will see but you will not perceive.
\v 15 For the heart of this people has become hard and they have barely listened with their ears and they have closed their eyes, so that they might not see with the eyes nor hear with the ears nor understand with the heart, nor turn back for me to heal them.”\rq Isaiah 6:9-10\rq*
\pi
\v 16 ‘But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
\v 17 For truly I tell you that many prophets and righteous ones longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
\pi
\v 18 ‘Now pay attention to the parable of the sower.
\v 19 All who listen to the message of the Kingdom, but without understanding, are those sown by the wayside: the evil one comes and carries away what has been sown in their hearts.
\v 20 And that which is sown on stony ground are those who hear the word and accept it immediately and take hold of it joyfully,
\v 21 but they have no root in themselves and they do not last. As soon as affliction or persecution comes on account of the word, they stumble.
\v 22 And that which is sown among the thorns are those who hear the word, but the distractions of this age and the deception of wealth throttle the word, and it is unfruitful.
\v 23 And that which is sown on good soil are those who hear the word with understanding, who then produce fruit: some yielding a hundred times over, and some sixty, and some thirty.’
\p
\v 24 He set before them another parable. He said, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like someone sowing good seed in his field.
\v 25 Then, while people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed poisonous ryegrass\f +\fr 13.25\ft This is probably darnel, the poisonous ryegrass Lolium Tremulentum.\f* among the wheat and went away.
\v 26 When the crop germinated and produced shoots, the ryegrass also appeared.
\v 27 The householder’s servants went and told him, “Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where then has the ryegrass come?”
\pi
\v 28 ‘He said to them, “Someone, an enemy, has done this.”
\pi ‘The servants asked him, “Do you want us to go and gather it up?”
\pi
\v 29 ‘But he said, “No. While gathering up the ryegrass you may uproot the wheat with it.
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I shall tell the reapers to gather up the ryegrass first and bind it in bundles for burning, and then to gather the wheat into my barn.”’
\p
\v 31 He set before them another parable, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
\v 32 Although the smallest of all seeds, when fully grown it is the largest of all the edible plants, becoming a tree in that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.’
\p
\v 33 He told them another parable. ‘The kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast that a woman took and mixed with three tubs\f +\fr 13.33\ft Literally, ‘three sata’. 1 saton = 3 gallons approx.\f* of flour until it was all leavened.’
\p
\v 34 All of this Jesus told the crowds in parables, and not once would he speak to them without a parable
\v 35 so that what was said through the prophet might be fulfilled: ‘I shall open my mouth in parables; I shall breathe out\f +\fr 13.35\ft ‘breathe out’ – Literally, ‘belch’; and therefore ‘utter’ by association with the idea of regurgitation. This is the only occurrence of the word in the New Testament.\f* things hidden from the foundation of the world.’\rq Psalms 77[78]:2\rq*
\p
\v 36 Then he dismissed the crowds and went home, and his disciples came to him, saying, ‘Explain to us the parable of the ryegrass in the field.’
\p
\v 37 In reply he told them, ‘The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
\v 38 and the field is the world. The children of the Kingdom are the good seed, and the children of the evil one are the ryegrass
\v 39 sown by the enemy, who is the devil. The harvest is the very end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
\v 40 Just as the ryegrass is gathered up and consumed by fire, so it will be at the very end of this age.
\v 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather up from his Kingdom all that offends, and those who work against the Law,
\v 42 and they will throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be wailing and the gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Let those who have ears for listening, listen.
\pi
\v 44 ‘Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure buried in a field that someone found and hid, and in his joy he went and sold everything, all that he had, and bought that field.
\pi
\v 45 ‘Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dealer looking for fine pearls.
\v 46 He found one extremely valuable pearl and went and sold everything, all that he had, and bought it.
\pi
\v 47 ‘Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net cast into the sea that gathered up all sorts.
\v 48 When it was full they hauled it on to the beach, sat down, and gathered up the good ones into buckets but threw the rotten ones away.
\v 49 This is how it will be at the very end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous
\v 50 and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be wailing and the gnashing of teeth.’
\p
\v 51 Jesus asked them, ‘Have you understood all these things?’
\p They told him, ‘Yes, Lord.’
\p
\v 52 He said to them, ‘That is why every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a householder who brings out from the storeroom new things and old.’
\p
\v 53 Then, when Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there
\v 54 and returned to his home town. He was teaching them in their synagogue, but they were completely bewildered, saying, ‘Where did this man get this wisdom? And the miracles!
\v 55 Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is his mother not called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?
\v 56 And are all his sisters not with us? Where then has this man come by all this?’
\v 57 And they took offence at him.
\p Jesus told them, ‘A prophet is not without honour except in his home town and in his own house.’
\v 58 And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
\p
\c 14
\v 1 At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard news of Jesus,
\v 2 and he said to his ministers, ‘This is John the Baptiser. He has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.’
\v 3 For Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,
\v 4 because John had told him, ‘It is not lawful for you to have her.’
\v 5 Although he wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the common people because they held him to be a prophet.
\v 6 But when Herod’s birthday came round, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and delighted Herod,
\v 7 and as a result he promised on oath to give her whatever she might ask.
\v 8 Prompted by her mother, she declared, ‘Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptiser.’
\p
\v 9 The king was grieved, but because of his oaths, and those dining with him, he ordered it to be granted.
\v 10 He sent to have John beheaded in the prison cell,
\v 11 and his head was brought in on a platter and given to the young woman; and she took it to her mother.
\p
\v 12 Then John’s disciples came, took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
\p
\v 13 When Jesus heard, he withdrew in a boat to a deserted place by himself. But the crowds got to hear and followed him on foot from the towns.
\v 14 On disembarking, Jesus saw a great crowd. He was moved with compassion for them and he healed their sick.
\p
\v 15 The day drew on, and his disciples came to him, saying, ‘This place is a wilderness and the hour is now late. Let the crowds go so that they may go into the villages to buy food for themselves.’
\p
\v 16 But Jesus told them, ‘They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.’
\p
\v 17 And they replied, ‘We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.’
\p
\v 18 He said, ‘Bring them here to me.’
\p
\v 19 Telling the crowds to sit down on the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven and blessed and broke them. He gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
\v 20 Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they took up the left over fragments: twelve baskets full.
\v 21 Those eating were about five thousand men, besides the women and children.
\p
\v 22 Immediately afterwards Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the far shore while he dismissed the crowds.
\v 23 Having sent the crowds away, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. Night was falling, and he was there alone.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile, the boat was now in the middle of the sea, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against them.
\v 25 Then in the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them, walking upon the sea;
\v 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were disturbed, saying, ‘It is a ghost,’ and they shrieked with fear.
\p
\v 27 But at once Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘Courage, it is I. Do not be afraid.’
\p
\v 28 Answering him, Peter said, ‘Lord, if it is you, call me to come to you over the water.’
\p
\v 29 And he said, ‘Come.’
\p Then, stepping down from the boat, Peter walked on the water towards Jesus.
\v 30 But seeing the strength of the wind he was afraid, and he began to sink. He cried out, saying, ‘Lord, save me!’
\p
\v 31 Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, ‘You of little faith. Why did you doubt?’
\p
\v 32 When they got into the boat the wind dropped.
\v 33 And those who were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, ‘Truly, you are the Son of God.’
\p
\v 34 Having made the crossing, they landed at Gennesaret.
\v 35 The men of that district recognised him and sent out into the whole of the surrounding countryside, bringing to him all who were ill.
\v 36 They pleaded with him that they might at least touch just the hem of his cloak, and all who touched it were completely healed.
\p
\c 15
\v 1 Then scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
\v 2 ‘Why are your disciples disobeying the tradition of the elders? For they are not washing their hands in the prescribed manner\f +\fr 15:2\ft ‘washing... in the prescribed manner’ is a single word in the Greek: ‘nipto’, to perform a ceremonial ablution.\f*  when they eat bread.’
\p
\v 3 Answering them, he said, ‘And why are you disobeying the commandment of God because of your tradition?
\v 4 For God commanded, saying, “Honour your father and mother” and, “Whoever speaks evil of father or mother, let them meet their end in death.”\rq Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9\rq*
\v 5 But you say that those who tell father or mother, “Whatever support you may have had from me is to be a votive offering” are not to honour their father or mother.
\v 6 You have therefore nullified the commandment of God through your tradition.
\v 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah rightly prophesied about you, saying,
\v 8 “These people come to me with their mouth and honour me with the lips, but their heart is far from me.
\v 9 They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines what are human regulations.”’\rq Isaiah 29:13\rq*
\p
\v 10 He called the crowd close and said to them, ‘Listen and learn.
\v 11 It is not what goes into the mouth that pollutes a person, but what comes out of the mouth: that pollutes the person.’
\p
\v 12 Then his disciples came to him and said, ‘Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard what was said?’
\p
\v 13 In reply he said, ‘Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
\v 14 Let them be. They are blind leaders of the blind, and if a blind person is guiding a blind person, both will fall into a ditch.’
\p
\v 15 Then Peter spoke, saying to him, ‘Explain this parable to us.’
\p
\v 16 And Jesus replied, ‘Are you still without understanding also?
\v 17 Do you not understand that everything going into the mouth passes on into the intestines and is expelled into the sewer?
\v 18 But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and that pollutes the person.
\v 19 For evil thoughts come out of the heart: murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, perjuries, blasphemies.
\v 20 These are what pollute a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not pollute a person.’
\p
\v 21 Leaving there, Jesus withdrew to the districts of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And then a woman appeared, a Canaanite from those borderlands. She cried out to him, saying, ‘Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is miserably afflicted by demons.’
\v 23 But he answered her not a word.
\p
\p His disciples came to him, pleading with him, saying, ‘Send her away because she is calling after us.’
\p
\v 24 He responded by saying, ‘I have been sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.’
\p
\v 25 Then she came forward and bowed to him, saying, ‘Lord, help me.’
\p
\v 26 But he replied, ‘It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the house dogs.’
\p
\v 27 She said, ‘True, Lord. But even so, the dogs live off the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.’
\p
\v 28 Then in reply Jesus told her, ‘Woman, you have great faith; let it be as you wish.’ And her daughter was healed at that instant.
\p
\v 29 Moving on from there, Jesus arrived beside the Sea of Galilee. He went up the mountain and sat there,
\v 30 and great crowds came to him bringing with them the lame, the blind, those unable to speak, the maimed and many others. They placed them at the feet of Jesus and he healed them.
\v 31 The crowds marvelled as they witnessed those unable to speak speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind able to see; and they glorified the God of Israel.
\p
\v 32 Jesus called his disciples to him and said, ‘I have compassion on the crowd because, for three days now, they have stayed with me, but they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, for they may faint on the road.’
\p
\v 33 And his disciples said to him, ‘Where in a wilderness are we to find enough loaves to satisfy such a large crowd?’
\p
\v 34 Jesus asked them, ‘How many loaves do you have?’
\p And they replied, ‘Seven, and a few small fish.’
\p
\v 35 He told the crowds to sit down on the ground.
\v 36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish; he gave thanks and broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
\v 37 They all ate and were satisfied. Then they took up the left over fragments: seven baskets full.
\v 38 Those eating were four thousand men, besides the women and children.
\p
\v 39 After dismissing the crowds, he boarded the boat and went to the district of Magdala.
\p
\c 16
\v 1 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, testing. They demanded that he show them a sign from heaven,
\v 2 but in reply he told them, ‘When it is evening, you say, “Fair weather, for the sky is red,”
\v 3 and in the morning, “Stormy today, for the sky is red, threatening.” Hypocrites! You know how to read the appearance of the sky, but you cannot understand the signs of the times.
\v 4 An evil and adulterous generation searches for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.’ And abandoning them, he moved on.
\p
\v 5 On reaching the far shore, his disciples had forgotten to bring bread.
\v 6 Jesus said to them, ‘Watch out, and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’
\p
\v 7 They discussed it among themselves, saying, ‘We brought no bread.’
\p
\v 8 Jesus knew, and he said, ‘You of little faith, why are you talking to each other about having brought no bread?
\v 9 Do you still not understand nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you collected?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you collected?
\v 11 How is it that you do not understand that I was telling you to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees, and not about the bread.’
\v 12 Then they understood that he did not mean ‘beware of bread yeast,’ but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\p
\v 13 Arriving in the district of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples, ‘Who do people say that I, the Son of Man, am?’
\p
\v 14 They replied, ‘Some, John the Baptiser; others, Elijah, or else Jeremiah or one of the prophets.’
\p
\v 15 He said to them, ‘But you, who do you say I am?’
\p
\v 16 Simon Peter answered. He said, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’
\p
\v 17 And in reply Jesus told him, ‘Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 And I tell you that you are Peter\f +\fr 16:18\ft Or ‘you are a rock’. Petros(Peter) is the masculine form of petra, a rock. The Aramaic form is Kephas.\f*, and upon this rock I shall build my Church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
\v 19 I shall also give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.’
\v 20 Then he instructed his disciples to tell no one that he, Jesus, was the Christ.
\p
\v 21 From then on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and to suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be put to death, and to be raised up on the third day.
\v 22 But Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, ‘God’s mercy to you, Lord, because this will never happen to you.’
\p
\v 23 Turning, he said to Peter, ‘Get behind me Satan. You are a hindrance to me, for you are not thinking God’s thoughts but human thoughts.’
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘If there are those who want to come after me, let them disown themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
\v 25 For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For how are people better off if they win the whole world but lose their soul? Indeed, what can they give in exchange for their soul?
\v 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and he will then reward each person according to what he or she has done.
\v 28 Truly I tell you, there are some among those standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.’
\p
\c 17
\v 1 Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John and brought them up a high mountain by themselves,
\v 2 and he was transfigured in their presence. His face shone like the sun and his clothes became white, just like light.
\v 3 And Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with him.
\v 4 Then Peter spoke. He said to Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, we will construct three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.’
\p
\v 5 While he was still speaking a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, ‘This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.’
\p
\v 6 When the disciples heard it they fell on their faces, for they were terribly afraid.
\v 7 But Jesus came and touched them and said, ‘Stand up, and do not be afraid.’
\v 8 And on raising their eyes they saw no one except Jesus. He was alone.
\p
\v 9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus gave them an order, saying, ‘Tell no one of the vision until the Son of Man rises from the dead.’
\p
\v 10 His disciples put a question to him, asking, ‘Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?’
\p
\v 11 In reply Jesus told them, ‘Elijah does indeed come first and he will restore everything.
\v 12 But I tell you that Elijah has come already. They did not recognise him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way the Son of Man is also about to suffer under them.’
\v 13 Then the disciples realised that he had spoken to them about John the Baptiser.
\p
\v 14 When they reached the crowd a man came up to him, knelt before him,
\v 15 and said, ‘Lord, have pity on my son because he has epilepsy and suffers terribly, for he often falls into the fire and often into water.
\v 16 And so I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.’
\p
\v 17 Replying, Jesus said, ‘Faithless and perverse generation. How much longer am I to be with you? How much longer am I to suffer you? Bring him here to me.’
\p
\v 18 When Jesus rebuked it, the demon left the boy and he was healed from that moment.
\p
\v 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, ‘Why were we not able to cast it out?’
\p
\v 20 And Jesus told them, ‘Because of your lack of faith. For truly I tell you that if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, “Move from here to there” and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.
\v 21 But this sort does not leave except by prayer and fasting.’
\p
\v 22 As they were going about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, ‘The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of the people,
\v 23 and they will kill him. But on the third day he will be raised up.’ And they were greatly distressed.
\p
\v 24 When they arrived in Capernaum the Temple tax collectors\f +\fr 17.24\ft ‘Temple tax collectors’ – Literally the ‘The two-drachma collectors’\f* came up to Peter and said, ‘Does your teacher not pay the two drachmas?’
\p
\v 25 He replied, ‘Yes he does.’
\p When he entered the house Jesus anticipated him, saying, ‘What do you think, Simon? The kings of the earth: from whom do they receive tolls or tribute? From their children or from other people?’
\p
\v 26 Peter told him, ‘From other people.’
\p Jesus replied, ‘Then the children are exempt.
\v 27 But in order not to offend them, go to the sea, cast a line, and take the first fish that comes up. Open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma piece.\f +\fr 17.27\ft ‘a stater' – At the time a stater was a  silver coin with a value of four drachmas.\f* Take it and give it to them on behalf of me and you.’
\p
\c 18
\v 1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus, asking, ‘Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?’
\p
\v 2 Jesus called forward a young child and stood him among them.
\v 3 He said, ‘Truly I tell you that unless you turn back again and become like little children you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven,
\v 4 for it is those who make themselves humble like this young child who are the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 5 Whoever welcomes one such child in my name is welcoming me,
\v 6 but anyone who causes one of these little ones who trust in me to stumble would be better off being drowned in the depths of the sea with a great millstone hung around the neck.
\pi
\v 7 ‘Woe to the world because of the snares of sin. And although snares are bound to appear, alas for that person by whom the snare is set.
\v 8 If your hand or your foot is causing you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed than with two hands and two feet to be thrown into the everlasting fire.
\v 9 And if your eye is causing you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.
\pi
\v 10 ‘See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven are always watching the face of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 11 Indeed, the Son of Man has come to save the lost.
\pi
\v 12 ‘What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders off, will that person not leave the ninety-nine, go up into the hills and look for the one that is wandering?
\v 13 And if it is found? Truly I tell you that there will be more rejoicing over that one than over the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
\v 14 In the same way it is not acceptable in the sight of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
\pi
\v 15 ‘If any of your brothers or sisters should sin against you, go and show them their fault, between you and them alone. If they listen to you, you have won back a brother, a sister.
\v 16 But if they do not listen, take with you one or two others so that in the face of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
\v 17 If they do not listen to them, tell it to the Church; and if they do not listen to the Church either, let them be to you just like the Gentile or the tax collector.
\pi
\v 18 ‘Truly I tell you that whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.
\v 19 Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything, whatever they may ask will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where there are two or three gathered in my name, I am there among them.’
\p
\v 21 Then Peter came to him and said, ‘Lord, how many times is my brother or sister to sin against me and I am to forgive? As many as seven times?’
\p
\v 22 Jesus told him, ‘I do not say as many as seven times, but as many as seventy times seven.
\pi
\v 23 ‘In this way the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
\v 24 When he began to settle up, one who owed ten thousand talents\f +\fr 18:24\ft A talent is about 25kg or 56lbs, and hence the value of this weight in silver. ‘ten thousand talents’ is to be understood as an unimaginable sum of money.\f* was brought in.
\v 25 As he had nothing with which to pay, his master ordered him to be sold with his wife and children and everything he had, and payment to be made.
\v 26 The servant then fell down before him, prostrating himself and saying, “Master, be patient with me and I shall pay you everything.”
\v 27 That servant’s master, moved with compassion, let him go free and discharged his debt.
\pi
\v 28 ‘As he left, that servant found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii\f +\fr 18:28\ft A denarius was a day’s wage for a labourer.\f*, and he grabbed hold of him and began to throttle him, saying, “Pay me what you owe.”
\pi
\v 29 ‘Falling at his feet, his fellow servant pleaded with him, saying, “Be patient with me and I shall repay you.”
\v 30 But he would not. No, he went and threw him in prison until he should pay what was owing.
\pi
\v 31 ‘When his fellow servants saw what had happened they were greatly distressed, and they went to their master and explained everything that had taken place.
\v 32 Then his master summoned him and told him, “Evil servant, I discharged that whole debt because you pleaded with me.
\v 33 Ought you not to have been merciful to your fellow servant as well, just as I was merciful to you?”
\v 34 And provoked to anger, his master handed him over to the tormentors until he should pay him all that he was owed.
\pi
\v 35 ‘This is what my Father in heaven will do to you too, each one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister’s transgressions from your heart.’
\p
\c 19
\v 1 When Jesus had finished this teaching he moved on from Galilee and came to the borderlands of Judaea beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 Great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
\p
\v 3 Then the Pharisees came to him, testing him and asking him, ‘Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?’
\p
\v 4 In reply he said to them, ‘Have you not read that he who created them at the beginning made them male and female,\rq Genesis 1:27\rq*
\v 5 and that he said, “This is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh”\rq Genesis 2:24\rq*?
\v 6 They are then no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has put together, let no one separate.’
\p
\v 7 They asked him, ‘Why then did Moses command that a certificate of divorce be given, and to send her away?’
\p
\v 8 He told them, ‘It was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but in the beginning it was not like that.
\v 9 I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another is committing adultery; and he who marries a woman who has been divorced is committing adultery.’
\p
\v 10 His disciples said to him, ‘If that is the situation with man and wife it is better not to marry.’
\p
\v 11 But he told them, ‘Not everyone accepts that reasoning: only those to whom it has been given.
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were born like that from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have kept themselves like that for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Those who can accept it should accept it.’
\p
\v 13 Then young children were brought to him, for him to lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked them,
\v 14 but Jesus said, ‘Let the children come to me and do not forbid them, for the Kingdom of Heaven is for such as these.’
\v 15 And having laid his hands on them, he moved on from there.
\p
\v 16 Then someone came up and asked him, ‘Good teacher, what good shall I do so that I may have everlasting life?’
\p
\v 17 He said to him, ‘Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, and he is God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.’
\p
\v 18 He asked him, ‘Which ones?’
\p And Jesus replied, ‘You shall not commit murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness;
\v 19 honour father and mother; and you shall love your neighbour as yourself.’\rq Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20; Leviticus 19:18\rq*
\p
\v 20 The young man said to him, ‘All these I have observed from my youth. What am I still missing?’
\p
\v 21 Jesus told him, ‘If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.’
\p
\v 22 But when the young man heard these words he went away sorrowful because he had many possessions.
\p
\v 23 Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Truly I tell you that the rich will enter the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.
\v 24 What is more, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God.’
\p
\v 25 When his disciples heard this, they were utterly astounded and asked, ‘Who then can be saved?’
\p
\v 26 Jesus looked straight at them and said, ‘For people this is impossible, but for God everything is possible.’
\p
\v 27 Then Peter spoke. He said to him, ‘You know that we have left everything and followed you. What will there be for us?’
\p
\v 28 Jesus said to them, ‘Truly I tell you that in the new beginning when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name’s sake will be recompensed a hundred times over, and will inherit everlasting life.
\v 30 But many who are first will be last, and those who are last, first.’
\p
\c 20
\v 1 ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like a property owner who went out as day was breaking to hire labourers for his vineyard.
\v 2 Having agreed with the labourers for a denarius a day, he then sent them into his vineyard.
\pi
\v 3 ‘He went out at about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
\v 4 and to these he said, “You too, go to the vineyard and I shall give you what is right.”
\v 5 And off they went. Going out again at about the sixth and the ninth hours he did the same.
\v 6 And at about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and he asked them, “Why have you stood here idle the whole day?”
\pi
\v 7 ‘They told him, “Because no one has hired us.”
\pi ‘He said to them, “You too, go to the vineyard and you will receive what is right.”
\pi
\v 8 ‘At nightfall the master of the vineyard said to his manager, “Call the labourers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first.”
\pi
\v 9 ‘Those of the eleventh hour came forward, and they each received a denarius.
\v 10 Then when the first came forward they supposed that they would receive more, but they too each received a denarius.
\v 11 As they took it they grumbled against the property owner
\v 12 saying, “These last ones laboured for one hour, yet you have made them equal with us who have borne the burden of the day and the fierce heat.”
\pi
\v 13 ‘Replying to one of them, he said, “Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree a denarius with me?
\v 14 Take what is yours and leave. I want to give this last one the same as you.
\v 15 Am I not allowed to do as I wish with what is mine? Is your eye envious because I am generous?”
\pi
\v 16 ‘In this way the last will be first and the first last, for many are called but few are chosen.’
\p
\v 17 While Jesus was on the road going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them,
\v 18 ‘Listen, we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes and they will condemn him to death.
\v 19 They will hand him over to the Gentiles for them to mock and flog and crucify, and on the third day he will be raised up.’
\p
\v 20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, bowing, and begging him for something.
\v 21 He asked her, ‘What do you want?’
\p She said to him, ‘Let it be known that these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right and one on your left, in your Kingdom.’
\p
\v 22 Replying, Jesus said, ‘You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised?’
\p They said to him, ‘We can.’
\p
\v 23 He told them, ‘You will indeed drink from my cup and be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised, but to sit on my right and on my left is not mine to grant, because it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.’
\p
\v 24 When the ten heard, they were indignant with the two brothers.
\v 25 But Jesus called them to him and said, ‘You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and those who are powerful wield authority over them?
\v 26 It shall not be like that among you, for whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant,
\v 27 and whoever wants to be first among you will be your slave,
\v 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life, a ransom for many.’
\p
\v 29 On leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
\v 30 Two who were blind could be seen sitting at the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by they shouted out, saying, ‘Lord, have mercy on us, you Son of David.’
\v 31 The crowd told them to be quiet, but they shouted out even more, saying, ‘Have mercy on us, Lord, you Son of David.’
\p
\v 32 Jesus stopped and called them, and said, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’
\p
\v 33 They told him, ‘Lord, that our eyes may be opened.’
\p
\v 34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately their eyes could see again, and they followed him.
\p
\c 21
\v 1 Drawing near to Jerusalem, they reached Bethsphage near the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent off two disciples,
\v 2 telling them, ‘Go into the village opposite and you will immediately find a tethered donkey and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
\v 3 And if anyone should say anything to you, you are to say, “The Lord has a use for them,” and they will be released at once.’
\p
\v 4 All this happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. He says,
\v 5 ‘Tell the daughter of Zion, “You will see your King coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.”’\rq Zechariah 9:9\rq*
\p
\v 6 The disciples went and did as Jesus asked them.
\v 7 They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their cloaks on them, and set him upon them.
\v 8 A very large crowd spread their own cloaks on the road, while others were cutting fronds from the trees and spreading them along the way.
\v 9 The crowds leading and those following were calling out, saying, ‘Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest!’\rq Psalms 117[118]:26\rq*
\p
\v 10 And when he entered Jerusalem the entire city was in turmoil, asking, ‘Who is this?’
\p
\v 11 And the crowds were replying, ‘This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.’
\p
\v 12 Jesus went into the Temple of God and drove out all who were selling and buying in the Temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the stalls of those selling doves.
\v 13 And he said to them, ‘It is written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer,”\rq Isaiah 56:7; Jeremiah 7:11\rq* but you have made it a den of thieves.’
\p
\v 14 Then the lame and the blind came to him in the Temple and he healed them.
\p
\v 15 The chief priests and the scribes were indignant when they saw the miracles he was performing and the children calling out in the Temple, saying, ‘Hosanna to the son of David!’
\v 16 They asked him, ‘Do you hear what they are saying?’
\p And Jesus told them, ‘Yes. Have you never read, “From the mouths of babies and infants at the breast you have perfected praise?”’\rq Psalms 8:2\rq*
\p
\v 17 Abandoning them, he left the city for Bethany and lodged there.
\p
\v 18 In the morning he was returning to the city. He was hungry,
\v 19 and seeing a solitary fig tree by the road he went up to it and found that there was nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, ‘May there never be any fruit from you again,’ and immediately the fig tree withered.
\p
\v 20 When they saw this, the disciples marvelled and asked, ‘How did the fig tree wither away so quickly?’
\p
\v 21 Jesus replied, saying to them, ‘Truly I tell you that if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do this to the fig tree, but even if you were to tell that mountain to be lifted up and thrown into the sea, it would happen.
\v 22 And everything, however much, you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive.’
\p
\v 23 He arrived at the Temple and was teaching when the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him and asked, ‘By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?’
\p
\v 24 In reply Jesus told them, ‘I shall also ask you one question, and when you answer me I shall then tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
\v 25 What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven, or was it of human origin?’
\p
\p They began arguing with each other, saying, ‘If we say from heaven, he will ask us, “Why then did you not believe him?”
\v 26 But if we say it was of human origin, we have the crowd to fear because everyone considers John to be a prophet.’
\v 27 And so they answered Jesus by saying, ‘We do not know.’
\p And he replied, saying to them, ‘Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.
\pi
\v 28 ‘But what do you think? There was a man who had two children. He went to the first and said, “My child, go and work in my vineyard today.”
\pi
\v 29 ‘The child answered, “I will not!” but afterwards regretted it and went.
\pi
\v 30 ‘Going to the second, he said the same thing, and that one answered, “Yes, sir,” but did not go.
\v 31 Which of the two did what the father wanted?’
\p They told him, ‘The first.’
\p
\p Jesus said to them, ‘Truly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the Kingdom of God.
\v 32 For John came to you along the road of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw this, even then you did not repent and believe him.
\pi
\v 33 ‘Listen to another parable. There was a property owner who planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a wine vat in it and built a tower. Then he let it out to vine-growers and went abroad.
\v 34 When the fruit season drew near he sent his servants to the vine-growers to collect his produce,
\v 35 but the vine-growers seized his servants. One they beat, one they killed, and one they stoned.
\v 36 Again he sent other servants, more than at first, and they treated them in the same way.
\v 37 Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, “They will respect my son.”
\pi
\v 38 ‘But when the vine-growers saw the son they said to themselves, “This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance.”
\v 39 And they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
\pi
\v 40 ‘Now when the master of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those vine-growers?’
\p
\v 41 They told him, ‘He will bring those wretched men to a miserable end, and then let out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will hand over the produce to him at the appropriate season.’
\p
\v 42 Jesus asked them, ‘Have you never read in the Scriptures, “The stone that the builders rejected is the one that became the chief cornerstone. This is the Lord’s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes”\rq Psalms 117[118]:22-23\rq*?
\v 43 This is why I am telling you that the Kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people bearing its fruit.
\v 44 Whoever falls over that stone will be dashed to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be ground to dust.’
\p
\v 45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables they knew that he was speaking about them.
\v 46 Though they wanted to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds because they considered him to be a prophet.
\p
\c 22
\v 1 Jesus began to speak. Once more he addressed them in parables, saying,
\v 2 ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who arranged a wedding for his son.
\v 3 He sent out his servants to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to come.
\v 4 Once more he sent other servants, saying, “Tell those who are invited, ‘Listen, I have prepared my wedding breakfast. My bullocks and my fatstock have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage feast.’”
\v 5 But they made light of it and went away, one to his own farm, another to his business.
\v 6 The others seized his servants, abused them and killed them.
\pi
\v 7 ‘When the king heard he was furious. He dispatched his soldiers and killed those murderers and burnt their city.
\v 8 Then he told his servants, “The marriage feast is indeed ready, but those invited were unworthy.
\v 9 Therefore go out to the street-corners and invite to the wedding everyone you find.”
\v 10 Those servants went out on the streets and gathered all whom they found, both good and bad, and the marriage feast was filled with guests.
\pi
\v 11 ‘The king came in to see the guests and saw someone there who was not dressed in wedding clothes.
\v 12 He asked him, “Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?” And he was speechless.
\v 13 Then the king said to the servants, “Bind him hand and foot. Take him away and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
\v 14 Because many are invited but few are chosen.’
\p
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went away and discussed how they might catch him out in what he said.
\v 16 They sent their own disciples to him with the Herodians. They said, ‘Teacher, we know that you are truthful. You teach the way of God as it really is, and it is no matter to you who anyone may be, because you do not go by appearances.
\v 17 Tell us then what you think. Is it right to give tribute to Caesar or not?’
\p
\v 18 But Jesus was aware of their malice, and he said, ‘Why are you testing me? Hypocrites!
\v 19 Show me the tribute money.’ They brought him a denarius.
\v 20 He asked them, ‘Whose is this image and inscription?’
\p
\v 21 They said, ‘Caesar’s.’
\p And he told them, ‘Well then, give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.’
\v 22 When they heard this they were astounded, and they left him and went away.
\p
\v 23 On that day Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection, came up to him and questioned him.
\v 24 They said, ‘Teacher, Moses said that if someone dies without having children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.
\v 25 Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and as he had no offspring he left his wife to his brother.
\v 26 Likewise, the second also. And the third, and on to the seventh.
\v 27 Last of all, the woman died too.
\v 28 At the resurrection then, of which of the seven will she be the wife, for they all had her?’
\p
\v 29 And in reply Jesus told them, ‘You are misled because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.
\v 30 For at the resurrection people neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven.
\pi
\v 31 ‘Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was told you by God? He said,
\v 32 “I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.”\rq Exodus 3:6\rq* God is not a God of the dead, but of the living.’
\p
\v 33 When the crowds heard this they were astonished by his teaching;
\v 34 and the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered around him.
\v 35 One of them, a lawyer, questioned him, testing him, saying,
\v 36 ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment of the law?’
\p
\v 37 Jesus told him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\rq Deuteronomy 6:5\rq*
\v 38 This is the first and great commandment;
\v 39 and the second is like it: you shall love your neighbour as yourself.\rq Leviticus 19:18\rq*
\v 40 The entire law and the prophets hang upon these two commandments.’
\p
\v 41 While the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus questioned them,
\v 42 asking, ‘What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?’
\p
\p They answered, ‘David’s.’
\p
\v 43 He said to them, ‘Then why does David, in the Spirit, call him Lord, saying,
\v 44 “The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a stool for your feet’”?\rq Psalms 109[110]:1\rq*
\v 45 If David calls him Lord, then how is he his son?’
\v 46 And no one was able to answer him a word. Nor from that day on did anyone dare ask him anything further.
\p
\c 23
\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
\v 2 saying, ‘The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses,
\v 3 so whatever they tell you to observe, observe it and do it. But do not do as they do, because they talk but they do not act.
\v 4 They lash together burdens which are heavy and painful to carry and set them on people’s shoulders, but they will not lift a finger to move them.
\v 5 Everything they do, they do to be seen by others. That is why they broaden their phylacteries and make much of the fringes of their robes.
\v 6 They love the top table at dinners and the front seats in the synagogues,
\v 7 and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called, “Rabbi, Rabbi” by the people.
\pi
\v 8 ‘But you are not to be called Rabbi, for there is one who is your Teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers and sisters.
\v 9 And do not call anyone on earth your Father, for there is one who is your Father, he who is in heaven.
\v 10 And do not be called Master, for there is one who is your Master, the Christ.
\v 11 But the greatest among you will be your servant,
\v 12 because those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
\pi
\v 13 ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you gobble up widows’ houses, and for effect make long prayers. That is why you will receive the greater condemnation.
\pi
\v 14 ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you close off the Kingdom of Heaven from the sight of the people. You yourselves do not enter, and you do not allow those who would enter to go in.
\pi
\v 15 ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you encompass the sea and the land to make one convert, and when that happens you make that person twice as much a child of Gehenna as yourselves.
\pi
\v 16 ‘Woe to you, blind guides. You say, “If someone swears by the sanctuary, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the sanctuary’s gold is under obligation.”
\v 17 Blind fools! For which is more important: the gold, or the sanctuary which is sanctifying the gold?
\v 18 And, “If someone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it is under obligation.”
\v 19 Blind fools! For which is more important: the gift, or the altar which is sanctifying the gift?
\v 20 In fact anyone who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it;
\v 21 and anyone who swears by the sanctuary, swears by it and by the one who resides in it;
\v 22 and anyone who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by the one who is seated upon it.
\pi
\v 23 ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you give tithes of mint and dill and cumin, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These things you must practise without neglecting the others.
\v 24 Blind guides, filtering out the gnat and swallowing the camel.
\pi
\v 25 ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and iniquity.
\v 26 Blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish so that the outside may be clean as well.
\pi
\v 27 ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you are like whitewashed tombs which do indeed appear beautiful on the outside, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth.
\v 28 And in the same way, it is true that you appear to people as righteous on the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
\pi
\v 29 ‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the graves of the righteous ones,
\v 30 and you say, “If we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have joined them in shedding the prophets’ blood.”
\v 31 You acknowledge to yourselves then that you are children of those who murdered the prophets,
\v 32 and you top up the measure of your ancestors.
\v 33 Snakes! Brood of vipers! How will you escape the damnation of Gehenna?
\pi
\v 34 ‘This is why when I send you prophets and people of wisdom and scribes, you will kill and crucify some of them, and you will flog some of them in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city.
\v 35 In this way all the innocent blood poured out on the earth will fall upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
\v 36 Truly I tell you that all these things will come upon this generation.
\pi
\v 37 ‘Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often have I longed to gather up your children as a hen gathers her own chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
\v 38 Understand that for you, your house is abandoned and deserted.
\v 39 And I tell you that from now on you will not see me, not until it is time to say, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”\rq Psalms 117[118]:26\rq*’
\p
\c 24
\v 1 Jesus left, and as he was coming out of the Temple his disciples came up to him to point out the Temple buildings.
\v 2 Jesus told them, ‘You see all of these, do you not? Truly I tell you that there is not a stone here that will remain upon a stone and not be thrown down.’
\p
\v 3 He was sitting on the Mount of Olives and the disciples came to him privately, saying, ‘Tell us when these things will happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age.’
\p
\v 4 Jesus replied, telling them, ‘Watch out that no one leads you astray,
\v 5 for many will come in my name, saying, “I am the Christ,” and they will lead many astray.
\v 6 Then you will begin to hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you do not lose your nerve, for all these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 All these things are but the beginning of the birth pains.
\v 9 Then they will hand you over to be ill-treated, and they will kill you; and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name.
\v 10 At that time many will stumble, and they will betray one another and hate one another.
\v 11 Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
\v 12 And because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold.
\v 13 But those who persevere to the end shall be saved.
\v 14 This Gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed to the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
\pi
\v 15 ‘Therefore when you see standing in the Holy Place the abomination of desolation\rq Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11\rq* of which the prophet Daniel spoke, let the reader understand,
\v 16 then those in Judaea should flee to the mountains;
\v 17 those on the housetop should not go down to collect anything from their house;
\v 18 those in the fields should not turn back to pick up their coats.
\v 19 Pity those who are with child and those breastfeeding in those days.
\v 20 Pray that your retreat is not in winter or on a Sabbath,
\v 21 for then there would be great anguish such as there has not been from the beginning of the world until now, and never will be.
\v 22 And if those days were not cut short, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the chosen those days will be shortened.
\pi
\v 23 ‘Then if anyone says to you, “Look, here is the Christ,” or, “Here,” do not believe it,
\v 24 for false christs and false prophets will arise, and they will produce great signs and wonders in order to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.
\v 25 Remember, I have forewarned you.
\v 26 And so if they tell you, “Look, he is in the desert,” do not go out; or, “Look, in the rooms inside,” do not believe it,
\v 27 for just as lightning flashes from the east and gives light as far as the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 28 For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered.
\pi
\v 29 ‘Immediately following the anguish of those days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will tumble.
\v 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will beat their breasts. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

\v 40 At that time there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left.
\v 41 Two women will be grinding in the mill; one will be taken and one left.
\v 42 Be vigilant therefore, because you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming.
\v 43 But understand this, that if the master of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and not allowed his house to be broken into.

\v 48 But if that bad servant says in his heart, “My master is delaying his return,”
\v 49 and if he starts beating his fellow-servants and is eating and drinking with drunkards,
\v 50 the master of that servant will return on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.

\v 1 ‘At that time the Kingdom of Heaven will be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
\v 2 Five of them were sensible and five foolish.
\v 3 When the foolish ones took their lamps they took no oil with them,

\v 40 ‘In reply the King will say to them, “Truly I tell you that whenever you did it for one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did it for me.”
\pi
\v 41 ‘And then he will say to those on the left, “Go from me, cursed ones, into the everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
\v 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give me a drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger and you did not take me in; naked, and you did not clothe me; ill and in prison, and you did not visit me.”
\pi
\v 44 ‘Then they too will answer him, saying, “Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison, and not minister to you?”
\pi
\v 45 ‘And he will answer them, saying, “Truly I tell you that whenever you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for me.”
\v 46 And they will go away to everlasting punishment, but the righteous to everlasting life.’
\p
\c 26
\v 1 When Jesus had finished saying all this, he said to his disciples,
\v 2 ‘You know that in two days the Passover is coming and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.’
\p
\v 3 The chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people then assembled in the courtyard of the High Priest, who was called Caiaphas,
\v 4 and together they discussed how to take Jesus by stealth and kill him.
\v 5 But they were saying, ‘Not during the feast or else there may be rioting among the people.’
\p
\v 6 Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper.
\v 7 A woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfumed oil, and she poured it on his head while he was seated at the table.
\v 8 When they saw it, his disciples were indignant and said, ‘Why this waste?
\v 9 This oil could have been sold for a great amount and the money given to the poor.’
\p
\v 10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, ‘Why are you troubling the woman over a good deed she has done for me?
\v 11 You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.
\v 12 When she poured this oil on my body she did it for my burial.
\v 13 Truly I tell you that wherever this Gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will also be told in memory of her.’
\p
\v 14 Then one of the Twelve called Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests.
\v 15 He said, ‘What are you willing to give for me to betray him to you?’ And they weighed out for him thirty silver pieces.
\v 16 From that time on he was looking for an opportunity to betray him.
\p
\v 17 On the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, asking him, ‘Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?’
\p
\v 18 He told them to go into the city to a certain person and to tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I and my disciples will keep the Passover with you.”’
\v 19 The disciples then did as Jesus instructed them, and they prepared the Passover.
\p
\v 20 When evening came he was at the table with the Twelve.
\v 21 While they were eating, he said, ‘Truly I tell you that one of you will betray me.’
\p
\v 22 Then in great distress they began to ask him in turn, ‘Perhaps it is I, Lord?’
\p
\v 23 And in reply he said, ‘Someone who dipped his hand into the dish with me will betray me.
\v 24 The Son of Man goes on his way as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for him if he had not been born.’
\p
\v 25 Then Judas, the one who betrayed him, spoke. He said, ‘Perhaps it is I, Rabbi?’
\p He told him, ‘It is as you say.’
\p
\v 26 While they were eating, Jesus took the bread; he gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ‘Take, eat; this is my body.’
\v 27 Then, taking the cup, he gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink from it, everyone,
\v 28 because this is my blood of the new covenant which is poured out on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins.
\v 29 I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you anew in my Father’s Kingdom.’
\v 30 And after singing God’s praise they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\p
\v 31 Jesus then told them, ‘This night you will all stumble because of me, for it is written, “I shall strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\rq See Zechariah 13:7\rq*”
\v 32 But after I am raised, I shall go before you into Galilee.’
\p
\v 33 Peter spoke, saying to him, ‘Even if everyone stumbles because of you, I at least will never stumble.’
\p
\v 34 Jesus said to him, ‘Truly I tell you that this night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.’
\p
\v 35 Peter said to him, ‘Even if I need to die with you, I shall never disown you.’ And all the disciples said the same.
\p
\v 36 Jesus then arrived with them at a place called Gethsemane, and he told his disciples, ‘Sit here while I go over there to pray.’
\v 37 Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and distressed.
\v 38 Jesus told them, ‘My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.’
\v 39 Going forward a little, he fell on his face and prayed, saying, ‘My Father, if it is possible let this cup pass from me. Yet not what I want, but what you want.’
\p
\v 40 He then returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, ‘So you were not able to watch with me for a single hour.
\v 41 Watch and pray so that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.’
\p
\v 42 Again, he went away a second time and prayed, saying, ‘My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me, but that I must drink it, your will be done.’
\v 43 And on his return he found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
\p
\v 44 He went away and left them once more. He prayed a third time, saying the same thing.
\v 45 Then he came to his disciples and told them, ‘From now on, sleep and rest. The hour is approaching and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Get up; let us go. Listen! The one who is betraying me is near.’
\p
\v 47 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, and with him was a large crowd with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\v 48 The one who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, ‘He whom I shall kiss, that is the man. Seize him.’
\v 49 He came up to Jesus at once and said, ‘Greetings, Rabbi.’ And he kissed him.
\p
\v 50 Jesus said to him, ‘Friend, why are you here?’ Then they came up, and taking hold of Jesus they arrested him.
\p
\v 51 One of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword; he struck the High Priest’s servant, taking off his ear.
\v 52 At this, Jesus told him, ‘Put your sword back in its place, for all who take up the sword will die by the sword.
\v 53 Do you think that I could not, even now, appeal to my Father who would provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way?’
\p
\v 55 At that moment Jesus said to the crowds, ‘Have you come out with swords and staves to seize me, as if against a bandit? I was sitting with you every day, teaching in the Temple, and you did not arrest me.
\v 56 But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled.’
\p All of the disciples then abandoned him and fled.
\p
\v 57 The arresting officers led Jesus away to Caiaphas the High Priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
\v 58 Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the High Priest. He went inside and sat with the officials to see the outcome.
\p
\v 59 Now the chief priests and the elders and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death,
\v 60 but they did not find it. Although many false witnesses came forward they found nothing,
\v 61 but afterwards two false witnesses did come forward and said, ‘This man declared, “I am able to throw down the sanctuary of God and rebuild it in three days.”’
\p
\v 62 Then the High Priest rose and said to him, ‘Have you no answer? Of what are these people accusing you?’
\v 63 But Jesus was silent. The High Priest responded by saying to him, ‘I put you on oath under the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.’
\p
\v 64 Jesus told him, ‘It is as you say. Not only that, I tell you that from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, coming on the clouds of heaven.’
\p
\v 65 Then the High Priest tore his robes, saying, ‘He has spoken blasphemously. What need have we of further witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy.
\v 66 What is your verdict?’
\p Their response was, ‘He deserves death.’
\p
\v 67 Then they spat in his face, and some punched and slapped him,
\v 68 saying, ‘Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is it that hit you?’
\p
\v 69 Peter was outside, sitting in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came up to him, saying, ‘You too were with Jesus of Galilee.’
\p
\v 70 But he denied it in front of them all, saying, ‘I do not know what you are talking about.’
\p
\v 71 He went out into the porch, and another woman saw him and said to those who were there, ‘This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.’
\p
\v 72 And again he denied it with an oath. ‘I do not know the man.’
\p
\v 73 After a while those standing nearby came and said to Peter, ‘Surely you are one of them as well, because even your speech gives you away.’
\p
\v 74 Then he began to curse, and he swore, ‘I do not know the man.’ And immediately a cock crowed.
\p
\v 75 And Peter remembered Jesus’ words, that he had told him, ‘Before the cock crows you will disown me three times,’ and he went outside and wept bitterly.
\p
\c 27
\v 1 Morning came, and all the chief priests and the elders of the people conspired against Jesus in order to put him to death.
\v 2 They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to the governor, Pontius Pilate.
\p
\v 3 When Judas, who betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he repented and took the thirty pieces of silver back to the chief priests and to the elders.
\v 4 He said, ‘I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.’
\p But they replied, ‘What is that to us? Deal with it yourself.’
\p
\v 5 Then he flung the silver pieces into the sanctuary and left, and he went and hanged himself.
\p
\v 6 The chief priests took up the silver pieces and said, ‘Because this is blood-money it is not lawful to put them in with the offerings,’
\v 7 and having conferred, they used them to buy the Potter’s Field for the burial of foreigners.
\v 8 It is why that field is called the Field of Blood to this day.
\v 9 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled. He said, ‘They took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of the one whose price had been set, the one upon whom those from among the children of Israel had set a price,
\v 10 and they gave them for the Potter’s Field as the Lord had directed me.’\rq Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9\rq*
\p
\v 11 Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him. He asked, ‘Are you the King of the Jews?’
\p Jesus told him, ‘It is as you say.’
\v 12 But when he was being charged by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond at all.
\p
\v 13 Pilate then asked him, ‘Do you not understand the seriousness of what they are accusing you?’
\v 14 But Jesus did not respond to him, not one word, and the governor was utterly perplexed.
\p
\v 15 At the feast the governor had been accustomed to release someone for the crowd: a prisoner, whomever they wanted.
\v 16 At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas,
\v 17 and so when they had gathered Pilate asked them, ‘Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?’
\v 18 For he realised that it was from envy that they had given him up.
\p
\v 19 While he was sitting in judgement, his wife sent to him, saying, ‘Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much in a dream today because of him.’
\p
\v 20 The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and do away with Jesus.
\v 21 The governor addressed them, asking, ‘Which of the two do you want me to release for you?’
\p And they said, ‘Barabbas.’
\p
\v 22 Pilate asked them, ‘What then shall I do with Jesus, the one called Christ?’
\p They all replied, ‘Let him be crucified.’
\p
\v 23 The governor demanded, ‘Why? What evil has he done?’
\p
\p But they called out ever louder, shouting, ‘Crucify!’
\p
\v 24 When Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather a riot was brewing, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, ‘I am innocent of this righteous man’s blood. You see to it.’
\p
\v 25 And all the people responded, saying, ‘His blood be upon us and upon our children.’
\p
\v 26 He then released Barabbas for them, and having flogged Jesus he handed him over to be crucified.
\p
\v 27 The governor’s soldiers then took Jesus into the Praetorium, and the whole cohort gathered around him.
\v 28 Having stripped him, they put a scarlet cloak on him.
\v 29 And plaiting a crown out of thorns, they set it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. They knelt before him and mocked him, saying, ‘Hail, the king of the Jews!’
\v 30 They spat at him, and taking the reed they beat him about the head.
\v 31 When they had mocked him, they removed the cloak from him and put his own clothes on him, then led him away to be crucified.
\v 32 On their way out they found a man, a Cyrenean named Simon, and conscripted him to carry his cross.
\p
\v 33 Arriving at the place called Golgotha, that is to say, ‘The Place of the Skull’,
\v 34 they gave him sour wine mixed with gall to drink. He tasted it but would not drink.
\v 35 They crucified him, and divided up his clothing by throwing dice.
\v 36 Then they sat there and watched him.
\v 37 Above his head they wrote up his crime: ‘This is Jesus, the King of the Jews’.
\p
\v 38 Two thieves were then crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
\v 39 The passers-by vilified him, shaking their heads
\v 40 and saying, ‘Sanctuary demolisher and three-day rebuilder! If you are the Son of God, save yourself, come down from the cross.’
\v 41 Similarly the chief priests with the scribes and elders and Pharisees were also jeering. They were saying,
\v 42 ‘Others, he saved; himself, he cannot save. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now so that we may believe in him.
\v 43 He trusted in God. Let him deliver him now if he wants him, for he said, “I am the Son of God.”’
\v 44 And it was the same with the thieves who were crucified with him. They taunted him.
\p
\v 45 From the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
\v 46 and at about the ninth hour Jesus called out in a loud voice, saying, ‘Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?’ That is, ‘My God, my God, why have you deserted me?’
\v 47 When those standing there heard, some said, ‘This man is calling Elijah.’
\v 48 And at once one of them ran and took a sponge. He filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink.
\v 49 But all the others were saying, ‘Leave him alone. Let us see if Elijah does come to save him.’
\p
\v 50 Jesus again called out in a loud voice, and he gave up the spirit.
\v 51 Then the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks split apart.
\v 52 The tombs were opened and the bodies of many holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised.
\v 53 After his resurrection they came out of the tombs, entered the Holy City, and appeared to many.
\p
\v 54 The centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that had happened, were utterly terrified. They said, ‘In truth, this was God’s Son.’
\p
\v 55 Many women were there as well, watching at a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.
\v 56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
\p
\v 57 When evening came, a rich man from Arimathea arrived. His name was Joseph and he was a disciple of Jesus.
\v 58 He approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave the order for the body to be released.
\v 59 Joseph took the body, wrapped it in pure fine linen
\v 60 and laid it in his new sepulchre which he had hewn in the rock. After rolling a large stone over the entrance of the sepulchre, he went away.
\v 61 Mary Magdalene was there with the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
\p
\v 62 On the next day, that is to say after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate.
\v 63 They said, ‘Sir, we recall that when that imposter was still alive he said, “I shall be raised after three days.”
\v 64 Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day in case his disciples should come by night and steal him away, and then tell the people, “He has been raised from the dead.” For this last fraud would be worse than the first.’
\p
\v 65 Pilate told them, ‘You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you know how.’
\v 66 They then went away and made the tomb secure with a guard, putting a seal on the stone.
\p
\c 28
\v 1 The Sabbath was over, and as it was coming light on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went with the other Mary to look at the tomb.
\v 2 And then there was a mighty earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven. He came and rolled away the stone from the entrance and sat on it.
\v 3 His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing, white as snow.
\v 4 The guards shook, terrified of him; they were like dead men.
\p
\v 5 The angel spoke. He said to the women, ‘Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.
\v 6 He is not here for he has risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying,
\v 7 then go quickly and tell his disciples, “He has risen from the dead and is going on ahead of you to Galilee where you will see him.” There! I have told you.’
\p
\v 8 They left the tomb quickly in fear and great joy, and ran to take the news to his disciples.
\v 9 But as were on their way to tell his disciples, Jesus met them, saying, ‘Rejoice!’ They came up and took hold of his feet, and they worshipped him.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers that they are to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.’
\p
\v 11 While they were on their way some of the guards reached the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
\v 12 When they had met with the elders to consider the matter, they gave the soldiers a considerable sum of money,
\v 13 telling them, ‘You are to say, “His disciples came during the night and stole him while we slept.”
\v 14 And if the governor gets to hear of this we shall reassure him, so you are not to worry.’
\v 15 They took the money and did as they had been instructed, and this story circulates widely among the Jews to this day.
\p
\v 16 The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them,
\v 17 and when they saw him they worshipped him, though some hesitated.
\v 18 Then Jesus came near and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
\v 19 Go, make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
\v 20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you every day until the end of the age.’ Amen.
