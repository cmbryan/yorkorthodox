\c 1
\v 1 The first account I gave, Theophilus, was about everything that Jesus started both to accomplish and to teach
\v 2 until the day on which he was taken up, having given instruction through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,
\v 3 and to whom he had presented himself alive by many proofs after his suffering, being seen by them throughout the forty days and relating things concerning the Kingdom of God.
\v 4 When he was together with them he commanded them, “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father which you heard from me.
\v 5 Indeed, John baptised with water, but after not many days you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.”
\p
\v 6 So when they had assembled they asked him, “Lord, are you at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel?”
\p
\v 7 He told them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons which the Father has appointed on his own authority.
\v 8 However, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
\p
\v 9 Having said this, as they were watching, he was taken up and a cloud received him from their sight.
\v 10 While they were staring up into the sky as he was going, two men clothed in white stood with them.
\v 11 They said, “Men, Galileans, why do you stand looking up at the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you saw him going into heaven.”
\p
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called [the Mount] of Olives which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey.
\p
\v 13 When they arrived they went up into the upper room where they were staying – that is, Peter and James and John and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James, son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot and Judas, son of James.
\v 14 All these, as one, were attending diligently to worship and prayer with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
\p
\v 15 In those days Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples – the aggregate of names was about a hundred and twenty – and said,
\v 16 “Men, brothers and sisters, it was necessary to fulfil that Scripture where the Holy Spirit made a prediction by the mouth of David about Judas who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus,
\v 17 how he was numbered among us and had received his share in this ministry.
\p
\v 18 Now, this man had acquired a plot of land with wages of wickedness and, falling face down, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.
\v 19 It then became known to everyone living in Jerusalem with the result that that place is called ‘Akeldama’ in the local dialect – that is, ‘Field of Blood’.
\p
\v 20 As it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his habitation become a wilderness and let no one live in it’; and, ‘Let another accept his responsibility.’\rq Psalms 68[69]:25, 108[109]:8\rq*
\p
\v 21 It is necessary, therefore – from the men who have been with us for the whole time that the Lord Jesus came and went among us,
\v 22 beginning from the baptism of John up to the day when he was taken up from us – for one of these to become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
\p
\v 23 So they put forward two: Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus; and Matthias.
\v 24 Then they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who knows the heart of everyone, reveal which one of these two you have chosen
\v 25 to receive a share in this ministry and apostleship which Judas violated, from which he was removed to his proper place.”
\v 26 Then they cast their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.
\c 2
\v 1 Now when the day of Pentecost arrived they were all together in the same place,
\v 2 and suddenly there came out of heaven a roar like a raging violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
\v 3 And divided tongues, just like fire, appeared and settled on each one of them.
\v 4 Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages according to what the Spirit was giving them to say.
\v 5 Residing in Jerusalem were Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.
\v 6 When this noise began great numbers assembled, and they were confused because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language.
\v 7 They were all astonished and marvelled, saying to one another, “Look! Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
\v 8 So how is it that we are each hearing our own mother tongue?
\v 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites; and those living in Mesopotamia as well as Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia;
\v 10 and also Phrygia and Pamphylia; Egypt and the coast of Libya around Cyrene; and the visitors from Rome, Jews, but also proselytes;
\v 11 Cretans and Arabians; we have heard them speaking in our languages the great things of God.”
\v 12 They were all amazed and bewildered, saying one to another, “What is this about?”
\v 13 But others, jeering, said, “They are full of new wine.”
\p
\v 14 Then Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, “Men, Jews, and every resident of Jerusalem, understand this and listen to what I am saying,
\v 15 for these men are not drunk as you suppose. It is only the third hour of the day!
\v 16 No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel,
\q1
\v 17 ‘And it will be in the last days, says God,
\q1 that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,
\q1 and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
\q1 and your young men shall see visions,
\q1 and your old men shall dream dreams.
\q1
\v 18 Yes, even upon my male and female servants in those days
\q1 I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.
\q1
\v 19 I will show wonders in the sky above,
\q1 and signs on the earth beneath
\q1 – blood and fire and haze of smoke.
\q1
\v 20 The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood
\q1 before the coming of the great and spectacular day of the Lord.
\q1
\v 21 And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’”\rq Joel 2:28-32\rq*
\m
\p
\v 22 “Men, Israelites, listen to these words. Jesus the Nazarene was a man among you, accredited by God by miracles and wonders and signs which God worked through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know.
\v 23 This is he – who by the ordained purpose and forethought of God was given up and seized by the hands of lawless men – whom crucifying, you killed,
\v 24 whom God raised up, having released the clutches of death because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
\v 25 For David says of him,
\q1 ‘I saw the Lord always in my sight
\q1 for he is at my right hand, so I shall not be moved.
\q1
\v 26 For this reason my heart rejoiced and my tongue jumped for joy;
\q1 and from now on my flesh, too, will be rooted in hope
\q1
\v 27 because you will not abandon my soul in hades,
\q1 nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption.
\q1
\v 28 You have shown me the paths of life.
\q1 You will fill me with joy by your presence.’\rq Psalms 15[16]:8-11\rq*
\m
\p
\v 29 Men, brothers and sisters, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 But, being a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him that, from the fruit of his loins according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit upon his throne.
\v 31 Having foreseen it, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul would not be left in hades, nor would his flesh see corruption.
\v 32 This Jesus, God has raised up; of this we are all witnesses.
\v 33 So then, being exalted at the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out what you now see and hear.
\v 34 For David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself declared,
\q1
\v 35 ‘The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand
\q1 until I make your enemies your foot-rest.’\rq Psalms 109[110]:1\rq*
\m
\v 36 Therefore let the whole house of Israel be assured that God has made him both Lord and Christ – this Jesus whom you crucified.”
\p
\v 37 Now, hearing this, they were pierced to the heart and they asked Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Men, brothers, what shall we do?”
\p
\v 38 Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit;
\v 39 for the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God shall call.”
\v 40 With many other words he was testifying and urging them, saying, “Save yourselves from this perverse generation.”
\p
\v 41 Then those who gladly accepted his message were baptised, and about three thousand souls were added on that day.
\p
\v 42 They began to devote themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers.
\v 43 Fear came on every soul; many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles.
\v 44 All who believed were together and had everything in common.
\v 45 They were selling possessions and property and were sharing them with everyone, according to each person's need.
\v 46 Day by day, as one, they were devoting themselves [to worship] in the temple, and also to the breaking of bread at home. They took their meals with gladness and with simplicity of heart,
\v 47 praising God and being favourably regarded by all the people. And day by day the Lord was adding to the Church those who were being saved.
\p
\c 3
\v 1 Together, Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour,
\v 2 and a man, lame from his mother’s womb, was being carried along. Every day they used to lay him at the temple gate called ‘Beautiful’, to beg for alms from those entering the temple.
\v 3 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for charity.
\v 4 Peter – John was with him – fixed his eyes on him and said, “Look at us.”
\v 5 He showed interest, expecting to receive something from them,
\v 6 but Peter said, “I have no silver or gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and start walking.”
\v 7 Seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.
\v 8 Then springing up, he stood upright and began to walk, and went with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
\v 9 When all the people saw him walking and praising God
\v 10 they recognised that it was the man who, for alms, used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
\v 11 As the lame man who had been healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran up to them in the colonnade called Solomon’s, utterly astounded.
\p
\v 12 Peter, seeing this, began to speak to the people, “Men, Israelites, why are you so astonished by this? Why are you staring at us as though it was by our own power or holiness that we made him walk?
\v 13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and disowned in the presence of Pilate when he had given judgement to release him.
\v 14 But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and begged for a man, a murderer, to be pardoned for you.
\v 15 Then you killed the Author of Life whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.
\v 16 And because of faith in his name, his name has strengthened this man whom you see and recognise. So the faith which he imparts has given him this physical well-being in the presence of you all.
\p
\v 17 Now, brothers, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did your leaders,
\v 18 but in this way God fulfilled what he had already announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that the Christ should suffer.
\v 19 Therefore, repent and come back – so that your sins may be blotted out, so that opportunities to be refreshed may come from the presence of the Lord,
\v 20 and so that he may send Christ Jesus, the One chosen for you,
\v 21 the One whom heaven must embrace until the times when all things are restored, of which God spoke long ago by the mouth of all his holy prophets.
\v 22 Moses, for example, said to the ancestors, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You shall hear everything, whatever he tells you.
\v 23 And it shall be that every soul who will not listen to that prophet shall be completely rooted out from among the people.’\rq Deuteronomy 18:15,18-19\rq*
\v 24 For all the prophets who preached, from Samuel and those who followed, have given notice of these days.
\v 25 You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘In your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.’\rq Genesis 22:18; 26:4\rq*
\v 26 God, having raised up his servant Jesus, sent him to you first, blessing you as each of you turns away from your wickedness.”
\p
\c 4
\v 1 As they were speaking to the people the priests and the Chief Officer of the temple and the Sadducees confronted them.
\v 2 They were aggrieved because they were teaching the people and preaching through Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
\v 3 So they laid hands on them and put them in prison until the following day, for it was already evening.
\v 4 But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of men came to about five thousand.
\p
\v 5 What happened in the morning was that their rulers and the elders and scribes were assembled in Jerusalem with
\v 6 Annas the High Priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander – and whoever else was related to the High Priest.
\v 7 Then, standing them in the centre, they demanded, “By what power, or in whose name, have you done this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, spoke to them, “Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,
\v 9 if we are being cross-examined today about a good deed done to invalid and how he has been healed,
\v 10 all of you, and all the people of Israel, should know that is it in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead – through him that this man stands before you whole.
\v 11 He is ‘the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.’\rq Psalms 117[118]:22\rq*
\v 12 And there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven that is given to us by which we must be saved.”
\p
\v 13 When they saw the confidence of Peter and John, and realising that they were uneducated and common men, they were astonished. They also recognised that they had been with Jesus.
\v 14 And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had no answer at all.
\v 15 Having told them to leave the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,
\v 16 saying, “What shall we do with these men? That a remarkable miracle has been performed through them is indeed obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we can not deny it.
\v 17 Nevertheless, so that it may not spread any further among the people, let us sternly forbid them to speak again to anyone in this name.”
\v 18 Then, summoning them, they charged them not to speak nor to teach at all in the name of Jesus.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and John answered them and said, “Whether it is right before God to listen to you rather than to God, you decide,
\v 20 for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.”
\p
\v 21 After they had issued further threats they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, because everyone was glorifying God for what had happened.
\v 22 Moreover, the man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.
\p
\v 23 On being released they went to their companions and reported to them all that the chief priests and the elders had said.
\v 24 When they heard, they lifted up a voice in unison to God, saying, “Master, Maker of the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,
\v 25 who by the mouth of your servant David said,
\q1 ‘Why do the nations rage and the peoples pay attention to vanities?
\q1
\v 26 The kings of the earth made a stand,
\q1 and the rulers mustered against the Lord and against his Christ.’\rq Psalms 2:1-2\rq*
\m
\p
\v 27 For truly, mustered against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, were both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the nations and the peoples of Israel
\v 28 to do whatever your hand and your purpose had ordained in advance should happen.
\v 29 And now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant that your servants may preach your word with confidence
\v 30 as you stretch out your hand for healing, and for signs and wonders to happen through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
\p
\v 31 And when they had prayed the place where they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and were proclaiming the word of God with confidence.
\p
\v 32 The great company of those who believed were of one heart and soul and none of them was saying that what they had was their own, but for them, everything was shared.
\v 33 So with great power the apostles bore witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and grace in abundance was upon them all.
\v 34 No one was in need because those among them who owned land or property were selling it, bringing the proceeds of what was sold,
\v 35 and laying it at the feet of the apostles. Then it was being distributed to each, according to the need of each.
\v 36 Joses – who was given the name Barnabas by the apostles, which translates as ‘Son of Encouragement’ – was a Levite, a Cypriot by birth.
\v 37 He sold a field that was his, brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 One man, Ananias by name, with his wife Sapphira, sold a property.
\v 2 He kept back some of the proceeds – his wife was also aware of this – but bringing a portion, he laid it at the feet of the apostles.
\v 3 Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the proceeds from the plot of land?
\v 4 As it stood, did it not remain your own? And having been sold, was [the money] not under your control? How is it that this affair was conceived in your heart? You have not lied to human beings, but to God.”
\p
\v 5 Hearing these words, Ananias fell to the ground and breathed his last. A great fear fell upon all who heard these things.
\v 6 The young men stood up,  wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.
\v 7 Now, about three hours later, not knowing what had happened, his wife came in.
\v 8 Peter asked her, “Tell me, was it for this amount that you sold the land?”
\p She replied, “Yes, for that amount.”
\p
\v 9 Then Peter said to her, “How was it that you conspired to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door – and they will carry you out!”
\p
\v 10 Instantly, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last; and the young men came in, found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her husband.
\v 11 A great fear fell upon the whole Church, and upon all who heard these things.
\p
\v 12 At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders took place among the people. They were all together in Solomon’s Colonnade
\v 13 and no one else dared to keep company with them even though the people were speaking highly of them.
\v 14 And more believers were being added to the Lord, large numbers of both men and women.
\v 15 They were even carrying out the sick into the streets and laying them on beds and mattresses so that as Peter came by, perhaps his shadow might fall on some of them.
\v 16 Large numbers were also flocking into Jerusalem from the towns round about, carrying the sick and those disturbed by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
\p
\v 17 Rising up, the High Priest and all who were with him – that is, the sect of the Sadducees – were filled with indignation.
\v 18 Then they laid their hands on the apostles and committed them to the public prison.
\v 19 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and, leading them out, said,
\v 20 “Go, stand in the temple and proclaim to the people all the words of this life.”
\p
\v 21 Taking heed of this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began teaching. Meanwhile, the High Priest appeared with his associates and they convened the Sanhedrin with the whole Council of the sons of Israel. Then they sent to the prison to have them brought.
\v 22 But when the officers arrived they did not find them in the prison. Returning, they reported,
\v 23 saying, “Even though we found the prison locked and totally secure with the guards standing at the doors, when we opened up we found no one inside.”
\p
\v 24 On hearing these words, the [High] Priest and the Chief Officer of the temple and the chief priests were baffled by them, by how this might end.
\v 25 But someone appeared bringing them the news, “Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.”
\v 26 Then the Officer went with his men and fetched them, without using force, for they were afraid of the people, that they might stone them.
\p
\v 27 They brought them to appear before the Sanhedrin, and the High Priest questioned them,
\v 28 saying, “Did we not give you an order not to teach in this name? Yet, look! You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching; and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.”
\p
\v 29 Responding, Peter and the apostles said, “We must submit to the authority of God rather than to human beings.
\v 30 The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging on a tree.
\v 31 This man, Prince and Saviour, God has raised to his right hand to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
\v 32 And we are his witnesses to these matters, and the Holy Spirit also whom God has given to those who obey him.”
\p
\v 33 Hearing this, they were convulsed with fury; and they determined to kill them.
\v 34 But someone stood up in the Sanhedrin – a Pharisee, Gamaliel by name, a teacher of the law respected by all the people. He ordered the apostles to be put outside briefly.
\v 35 Then said to them, “Men of Israel, think carefully about what you intend to do to these men.
\v 36 Some time ago Theudas turned up, claiming to be someone, to whom a number of men – about four hundred – gave their support. He was killed and all those who were relying on him were scattered, and it came to nothing.
\v 37 After that, Judas of Galilee turned up – at the time of the census – and he attracted a good number of people to back him. He also perished, and all those who were relying on him were dispersed.
\v 38 So now I say to you, have nothing to do with these men and let them be – because if this strategy or work is of human [origin], it will come to nothing;
\v 39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to bring it down – and you might also be found to be fighting against God.”
\p
\v 40 They agreed with him. Summoning the apostles, they flogged them, ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.
\v 41 They went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing that, for the sake of his name, they had been considered worthy to suffer dishonour.
\p
\v 42 Every day, both in the temple and at home, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming Jesus, the Christ.
\p
\c 6
\v 1 In those days, when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists began complaining to the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of relief.
\v 2 The Twelve called together the great company of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate that we abandon the word of God to serve at tables.
\v 3 So, brothers and sisters, select from among yourselves seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint for this necessary task,
\v 4 and we ourselves will concentrate on prayer and the ministry of the word.”
\p
\v 5 And what was said pleased the whole company, so they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch;
\v 6 whom they presented to the apostles. And they prayed and laid hands on them.
\v 7 Then the word of God spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased substantially. Indeed, a great crowd of Jews became obedient to the faith.
\p
\v 8 Stephen, full of faith and power, was performing wonders and great signs among the people.
\v 9 But some of those of the so-called ‘Synagogue of the Freedmen’ – and also Cyrenians, Alexandrians and those from Cilicia and Asia – rose up, questioning Stephen;
\v 10 but they were not able to stand up against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
\v 11 Then they secretly prompted men to say, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”
\v 12 They also stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and having confronted him, they seized him and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
\v 13 They even produced false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemies against this holy place and against the law,
\v 14 for we have heard him saying that this Jesus of Nazareth will demolish this place and change the customs which Moses has handed down to us.”
\v 15 Staring at him, all those sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his face as the face of an angel.
\p
\c 7
\v 1 The High Priest asked, “Are these things really so?”
\p
\v 2 Then Stephen declared, “Men, brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
\v 3 and said to him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives and come here to a land which I shall show you.’\rq Genesis 12:1\rq*
\v 4 At that time, having left the land of the Chaldaeans, he settled in Haran. From there, after the death of his father, God moved him to this land where you now live.
\v 5 He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a place to stand, but he promised to give it as a possession to him and to his descendants after him – yet he had no child.
\v 6 But for all that, God said that his descendants would be migrants in a foreign land, and would be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.
\v 7 But, ‘I will judge the nation which they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall leave and worship me in this place.’\rq Genesis 15:13-14\rq*
\v 8 Then he gave him a covenant of circumcision, and after that he fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac fathered Jacob; and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.
\p
\v 9 Then the patriarchs, driven by jealousy, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him
\v 10 and rescued him from all his afflictions. He gave him grace and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he appointed him ruler over Egypt and his entire household.
\v 11 A famine came upon the land, the whole of Egypt and Canaan, with great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food.
\v 12 Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, sent out our fathers the first time;
\v 13 and on the second [occasion] Joseph made himself known to his brothers; and Joseph’s family was revealed to Pharaoh.
\v 14 Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives – about seventy-five souls.
\v 15 So Jacob went down to Egypt. He died, both he and our ancestors,
\v 16 and they were carried back to Shechem and were laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.
\p
\v 17 And so it was, as the time for the promise which God had sworn to Abraham was approaching, that the people increased and became numerous in Egypt
\v 18 until a different king arose who had not known Joseph.
\v 19 This one was underhand with our nation and ill-treated our ancestors, forcing them to expose their new-born infants so that they would not live.
\v 20 At that time Moses was born, and he was pleasing to God; and for three months he was nurtured in his father’s house.
\v 21 Then, when he was exposed, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up and brought him up herself, as a son.
\v 22 So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in words and deeds.
\v 23 But when he was forty years old he was minded to go and see his brothers and sisters, the children of Israel;
\v 24 and observing one of them suffering unjustly, he defended and avenged the oppressed man, striking down the Egyptian.
\v 25 He supposed that his own people understood that by his hand God was giving them deliverance; but they did not understand.
\p
\v 26 On the following day he was seen by them as they were quarrelling, and he urged them to make peace, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers! Why are you unjust to each other?’
\v 27 But the one who was being unjust to [his] fellow man pushed him away, saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’\rq Exodus 2:14\rq*
\v 29 At these words Moses fled; and he became an immigrant in the land of Midian where he fathered two sons.
\p
\v 30 After forty years had passed an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the Mount Sinai desert, in a bush fire’s flame.
\v 31 When Moses saw it he was intrigued by the sight and, as he was going closer to see, the voice of the Lord came to him,
\v 32 ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’\rq Exodus 3:6\rq* Then Moses began to quake with fear and did not dare look.
\v 33 The Lord said to him, ‘Untie your sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.
\v 34 Listen! I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt and heard their sighs, and I have come down to rescue them. So now, come! I will send you to Egypt.’\rq Exodus 3:5,7-8,10\rq*
\p
\v 35 This Moses – whom they had rejected, saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge?’ — this is he whom God sent as ruler and deliverer by the hand of an angel who appeared to him in the bush.
\v 36 This man, having worked wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, led them out by the Red Sea and into the wilderness for forty years.
\v 37 This is the Moses who said to the children of Israel, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among yourselves; you shall listen to him.’\rq Deuteronomy 18:15\rq*
\v 38 It was he who was in the congregation in the wilderness – with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors – who received the words of life to give to us.
\v 39 To him, our ancestors were not willing to become obedient, but rejected him and, in their heart, turned back to Egypt.
\v 40 They said to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go in front of us, for we do not know what has become of this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt.’\rq Exodus 32:1\rq*
\v 41 In those days they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, rejoicing in their handiwork.
\v 42 Then God turned. He gave them up to worship the stars of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the prophets,
\q1 ‘Would you offer me slaughtered beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, House of Israel?
\q1
\v 43 Yes, you lifted up the Tabernacle of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan,
\q1 the images which you made to be reverenced;
\q1 therefore I shall exile you beyond Babylon.’\rq Amos 5:25-27 LXX\rq*
\m
\p
\v 44 With our ancestors in the wilderness was the Tabernacle of the Testament, made as the one who was speaking to Moses had directed, according to the model which he had seen.
\v 45 It was then received in turn by our ancestors, and brought in by Joshua [when they took] possession from the nations whom God drove out in the face of our ancestors, until the time of David.
\v 46 He found favour in the sight of God, and wanted to secure a temple for the God of Jacob.
\v 47 Then Solomon built him a House,
\v 48 but the Most High does not live in sanctuaries of human construction. As the prophet says,
\q1
\v 49 ‘Heaven is my throne and the earth my foot-rest.
\q1 What kind of house will you build for me?’ says the Lord, ‘and where [will be] the location of my residence?
\v 50 Have my hands not made all these things?’\rq Isaiah 66:1-2\rq*
\m
\p
\v 51 Obstinate people! And uncircumcised in heart and ears! You are forever resisting the Holy Spirit – you too, just like your ancestors.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers;
\v 53 you, who received the law by means of angels but did not keep it.”
\p
\v 54 Now, when they heard this they were convulsed with fury and gnashed their teeth at him.
\v 55 But, full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God – and Jesus, standing on the right of God.
\v 56 He exclaimed, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right of God.”
\p
\v 57 Crying out with a loud voice they covered their ears, and as one, they rushed upon him.
\v 58 Throwing him out of the city, they began stoning him. And the witnesses placed their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
\v 59 As they were stoning Stephen he was calling out, saying, “Lord Jesus! Receive my spirit!”
\v 60 Then, falling to his knees, he cried with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” Saying this, he fell asleep.
\p
\c 8
\v 1 Saul, with the others, approved of the death, and on that day a great persecution came upon the Church in Jerusalem and they were all scattered thoughout the provinces of Judea and Samaria – except for the apostles.
\v 2 Devout men carried Stephen away for burial and made a great lamentation over him.
\v 3 Meanwhile Saul was causing havoc in the Church, entering each house and dragging away both men and women, putting them in prison.
\p
\v 4 But those who had been scattered went everywhere, proclaiming the word.
\v 5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.
\v 6 The crowds were paying heed to what was said by Philip, united in their listening and watching the signs he was performing –
\v 7 because unclean spirits, shouting with a great cry, were coming out of many who were possessed, and many who had been paralysed and unable to walk were healed;
\v 8 and there was great joy in that city.
\v 9 But there was one man, Simon by name, who had previously bewitched the people of Samaria using sorcery, claiming to be someone great.
\v 10 They all had regard for him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the great power of God.”
\v 11 They heeded him because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
\v 12 But when they believed Philip’s proclamation of the Gospel, the things concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised: both men and women.
\v 13 Simon himself also believed, and after being baptised he stuck closely to Philip. Then, seeing miracles and signs taking place, he was astounded.
\p
\v 14 The apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God and sent Peter and John to them.
\v 15 When they came down they prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
\v 16 for as yet he had fallen on none of them, but they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 17 Then they laid hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 Simon, seeing that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, offered them money,
\v 19 saying, “Give me this authority too, so that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”
\v 20 But Peter said to him, “Your silver be with you in damnation! – because you thought you could acquire the gift of God by means of money.
\v 21 For you there is no share, no inheritance, in this matter because your heart is not right before God.
\v 22 So repent of this wickedness of yours and beg God that somehow the thought in your heart might be forgiven you,
\v 23 for I see you are under the poison of bitterness and the control of iniquity.”
\p
\v 24 Then Simon answered. He said, “Pray for my sake to God so that none of the things you have said may come upon me.”
\p
\v 25 Then, having given solemn testimony and spoken the word of the Lord, they made their way back to Jerusalem, proclaiming the Gospel in many Samaritan villages.
\p
\v 26 Now, an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Get up and travel southwards on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is desert.
\p
\v 27 So he got up and travelled on. And look! There was a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch, a man of great authority under Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians. He had charge of all her treasure and had come to worship in Jerusalem.
\v 28 He was now returning, sitting upon his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.
\p
\v 29 The Spirit said to Philip, “Get up close and stick with this chariot.”
\p
\v 30 Philip ran up, heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and asked, “Do you not understand what you are reading?”
\p
\v 31 He said, “How can I unless someone shows me the way?” Then he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
\v 32 Now, the passage of Scripture he was reading was this,
\q1 ‘He was led as a sheep to slaughter,
\q1 and as a lamb before his shearer is silent, so he does not open his mouth.
\q1
\v 33 In his humiliation justice was taken from him.
\q1 Who shall describe his generation?
\q1 For his life is taken from the earth.’\rq Isaiah 53:7,8 LXX\rq*
\m
\p
\v 34 The eunuch responded, asking Philip, “Please, about whom is the prophet saying this? About himself? Or about someone else?”
\p
\v 35 Then Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this Scripture he proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus to him.
\v 36 As they travelled along the road they came upon some water, and the eunuch spoke his mind, “Look! Water! What prevents me being baptised?”
\p
\v 37 Philip said, “If you believe from your whole heart, you may.” And he answered, “I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.”
\v 38 He ordered the chariot to stop and both of them went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised him.
\p
\v 39 When they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away and the eunuch saw him no more; but he went on his way rejoicing.
\v 40 Then Philip was found at Azotus and, travelling everywhere, he was proclaiming the Gospel in every town until he reached Caesarea.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 But Saul, still breathing menace and murder towards the disciples of the Lord, went to the High Priest
\v 2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus so that if he found any who were of ‘The Way’, both men and women, he might bring them captive to Jerusalem.
\v 3 As he was travelling, beginning to approach Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven  shone around him.
\v 4 Falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”
\p
\v 5 He asked, “Who are you, Lord?”
\p and the Lord said, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
\v 6 Now get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you must do.”
\p
\v 7 The men who were travelling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
\v 8 Then Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. They led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus;
\v 9 and for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank.
\p
\v 10 Now there was a disciple named Ananias in Damascus, and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!”
\p and he replied, “See! It is I, Lord.”
\p
\v 11 Then the Lord [said] to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight, and in the house of Judas enquire by name for Saul of Tarsus – because, look! He is praying.
\v 12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying a hand on him so that he might see again.”
\p
\v 13 But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard about this man from many people, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem,
\v 14 and he has authority here from the chief priests to take captive all who call on your name.”
\p
\v 15 But the Lord said to him, “Go! – because this man is a chosen vessel for me, to lift up my name before nations and kings as well as the children of Israel,
\v 16 and I will show him how much he must suffer on account of my name.”
\p
\v 17 Ananias set off and entered the house and, laying hands upon him, he said, “Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me – Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came – so that you might see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
\v 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he saw again. He rose and was baptised.
\v 19 Then he accepted some food and was strengthened.
\p Saul was with the disciples who were in Damascus for some days.
\v 20 Soon he was in the synagogues preaching Jesus, that he is the Son of God,
\v 21 and all who heard him were amazed and were saying, “Is this not the man who dealt destruction to those in Jerusalem invoking this name, and who had come here with the intention of taking them away captive to the chief priests?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul became even stronger, and he was confounding the Jews living in Damascus, proving that this man is the Christ.
\p
\v 23 When quite a few days had passed the Jews conspired to kill him,
\v 24 but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates both by day and by night so they might kill him,
\v 25 but the disciples got hold of him and, by night, let him down from the wall, lowered in a basket.
\v 26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas, getting hold of him, led [him] to the apostles; and he described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had been speaking openly in the name of Jesus.
\v 28 Then he was with them, coming and going in Jerusalem, and speaking openly in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 29 He was was speaking and debating with the Hellenists, but they tried to kill him.
\v 30 Being aware of this, the brothers and sisters took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 Then, truly, the Churches throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace. They were built up and, living in the fear of the Lord and in the consolation of the Holy Spirit, they multiplied.
\p
\v 32 While Peter was travelling all over, he also went down to the saints who were living in Lydda.
\v 33 He found there a man, Aeneas by name, who was paralysed, bedridden for eight years.
\v 34 So Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus, the Christ, heals you. Get up and make your bed.” And he immediately got up.
\v 35 Then everyone living in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
\p
\v 36 There was a disciple in Joppa named Tabitha – which translates as Dorcas [or Gazelle]. This woman was full of good works and did acts of mercy,
\v 37 but at that time, falling ill, she died. They washed her and laid her in an upper room.
\v 38 As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him not to delay in coming over to them.”
\v 39 So Peter rose and went with them. When he arrived they led him to the upper room, and all the widows stood around him, weeping, and displaying all the clothes and garments Dorcas had been making while she was with them.
\v 40 But Peter sent them all outside, knelt down, and prayed. Turning to the body he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.
\v 41 Giving her his hand he raised her up and, calling out to the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
\v 42 It became known throughout the whole of Joppa and many believed in the Lord.
\v 43 He remained in Joppa for some days – with Simon, a tanner.
\p
\c 10
\v 1 A man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the so-called ‘Italian Cohort’,
\v 2 was, with his entire household, devout and God-fearing, performing many acts of generosity towards the people and constantly praying to God.
\v 3 At about the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, “Cornelius!”
\p
\v 4 He stared at him and became fearful. He said, “What is it, lord?”
\p He replied, “Your prayers and your alms-giving have risen up as a record in the presence of God.
\v 5 Now, dispatch men to Joppa and call Simon, the one also called Peter.
\v 6 He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is near the sea.”
\p
\v 7 When the angel who was speaking to Cornelius had departed he spoke to two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those loyal to him
\v 8 and, explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 The next day as these men were travelling and approaching the city Peter went up at about noon onto the housetop to pray.
\v 10 He became very hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing [it] a trance overcame him,
\v 11 and he saw heaven opened and descending towards him a contraption like a large sheet tied at the four corners and let down upon the earth.
\v 12 In it were all the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the small crawling things and the birds of the air.
\v 13 Then a voice came to him, “Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.”
\p
\v 14 But Peter said, “Definitely not, Lord! – for I have never eaten anything profane or unclean.”
\p
\v 15 Then again, a second time, a voice [spoke], “What God has made clean you are not to denounce as profane.”
\v 16 This happened three times. Then once more the contraption was taken up into heaven.
\v 17 As Peter, within himself, was puzzling over what the vision he had seen might mean, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having enquired for Simon’s house, stood at the gate.
\v 18 They called out, asking whether Simon, also called Peter, was lodging there.
\v 19 As Peter continued to reflect on the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Look! Three men are asking for you.
\v 20 Get up, go down, and go with them. Do not hesitate, for I have sent them.”
\p
\v 21 Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you seek. What is the reason for you being here?”
\p
\v 22 And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, and also well-attested by the whole nation of the Jews, was instructed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you had to say.”
\v 23 Then he invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he got up and set out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him,
\v 24 and on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends.
\v 25 As Peter made his entrance Cornelius met him, fell at his feet and prostrated himself.
\v 26 But Peter raised him up, saying, “Stand up. I myself am also a man.”
\v 27 Then, as they talked together, he went in and found that many had assembled.
\v 28 Peter said to them, “You yourselves understand that it is not lawful for a Jewish man to associate with, or visit, someone of another nation, but God has shown me not to call anyone profane or unclean.
\v 29 Therefore I came without protest when I was sent for. So I ask, what is the reason you sent for me?”
\p
\v 30 Then Cornelius spoke what was on his mind, “Until this time four days ago I was fasting, and at the ninth hour, praying in my house, I saw standing in front of me a man in bright clothing,
\v 31 and he said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your acts of generosity have been brought to mind in the sight of God.
\v 32 Therefore, send to Joppa and call Simon who is also called Peter. He is staying in the house of Simon, a tanner, near the sea. When he comes he will speak to you.’
\v 33 So I sent for you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now then, we are all present in the sight of God to hear everything that has been asked of you by God.”
\p
\v 34 Peter opened his mouth and said, “Truly, I perceive that God does not show partiality
\v 35 but in every nation those who fear him and are committed to righteousness are acceptable to him.
\v 36 The word he sent to the children of Israel announcing the Gospel of peace through Jesus Christ, he who is Lord of all,
\v 37 you yourselves know about – how the word came to all Judea, starting from Galilee after the baptism which John preached;
\v 38 how Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power, went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
\v 39 And we – we are witnesses of everything he did, both in the countryside of Judea and in Jerusalem. And he is the one they killed by hanging [him] on a tree.
\v 40 God raised him up on the third day and granted that he might be revealed,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses, to those who were chosen beforehand by God – to us who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.
\v 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to give full testimony that he is the one ordained of God as Judge of the living and of the dead.
\v 43 This is he to whom all the prophets bear witness, that through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.”
\p
\v 44 While Peter was still speaking of these matters the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the word,
\v 45 and those of the circumcision, the believers who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles,
\v 46 for they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God.
\p Then Peter said,
\v 47 “Does anyone have the power to withhold the water for these people to be baptised – these who have received the Holy Spirit just like us?”
\v 48 So he ordered them to be baptised in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay for some days.
\p
\c 11
\v 1 The apostles and the brothers and sisters who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God,
\v 2 and when Peter came up to Jerusalem those who were of the circumcision criticized him
\v 3 saying, “You went into [the house of] uncircumcised men and ate with them!”
\p
\v 4 So Peter explained to them from the beginning, saying,
\v 5 “I was in the city of Joppa, praying, and in a trance I saw a vision – a contraption descending like a great sheet being let down from heaven by the four corners until it reached me.
\v 6 Staring at it, on close inspection I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the small crawling things and the birds of the air.
\v 7 I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’
\v 8 But I said, ‘Definitely not, Lord! – for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’
\v 9 But a voice from heaven spoke to me a second time, ‘What God has made clean you are not to denounce as profane.’
\v 10 This happened three times, then once more everything was taken up into heaven.
\v 11 Then, look! At that moment three men stood in front of the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea.
\v 12 Then the Spirit told me to go with them without delay, and these six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.
\v 13 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying to him, ‘Send men to Joppa to call Simon who is also called Peter.
\v 14 He will speak to you the words through which you will be saved, you and all your household.’
\v 15 As I began to speak the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as on us at the beginning,
\v 16 and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, ‘John did indeed baptise in water, but you will be baptised in the Holy Spirit.’
\v 17 If, then, God had given them the same gift that he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to impede God?”
\p
\v 18 When they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God, saying, “So be it! Without doubt God has granted repentance to life to the Gentiles also.”
\p
\v 19 Now those who had been scattered by the persecution which had come about following Stephen had travelled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to no one except Jews.
\v 20 But some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene who arrived in Antioch, were speaking to the Greeks, proclaiming the Gospel of the Lord Jesus,
\v 21 and the hand of the Lord was with them. A great number believed and turned to the Lord.
\v 22 News of these things came to the ears of the Church in Jerusalem, so they sent out Barnabas to travel as far as Antioch.
\v 23 When he arrived and saw the grace of God he rejoiced. He encouraged them all to remain close to the Lord with firm purpose of heart.
\v 24 Because he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and faith, another large company was added to the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Then Barnabas went off to Tarsus to look for Saul,
\v 26 and when he found him he brought him to Antioch. So it was, that, for a whole year, they met together with the Church and taught a large congregation. The disciples were first given the title of ‘Christians’ in Antioch.
\p
\v 27 In those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,
\v 28 and one of them, Agabus by name, stood up and made known through the Spirit that there was about to be a great famine throughout the whole world – which happened in the time of Claudius Caesar –
\v 29 and the disciples determined, according to the means of each, to send relief to the brothers and sisters living in Judea.
\v 30 This, indeed, they did, sending it to the presbyters by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
\p
\c 12
\v 1 At about that time Herod the King laid hands on some in the Church to make mischief.
\v 2 James, the brother of John, he put to the sword.
\v 3 When he saw that this pleased the Jews he went further, and in the days of Unleavened Bread he also seized Peter
\v 4 whom he arrested, put in prison, and handed over to four squads of four soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.
\v 5 While Peter was being guarded in the prison constant prayer to God was being kept up by the Church on his behalf.
\v 6 The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, and in front of the gate sentries were guarding the prison.
\p
\v 7 Then, look! An angel of the Lord stood there, and a light shone in the cells. Prodding Peter in the ribs, he roused him saying, “Get up quickly,” and his chains fell from his hands.
\v 8 The angel then said to him, “Get dressed and put on your sandals,” and he did so. And then he said, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”
\v 9 Setting off, he was following him, but he did not realise that what the angel was doing was real. He supposed he was seeing a vision.
\v 10 Having passed through the first and second guardrooms they arrived at the iron gate leading out into the city, and it opened for them of its own accord. Going through it, they proceeded down one street, then suddenly the angel left him.
\p
\v 11 Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know it is true that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”
\v 12 Being fully aware of this, he went to the home of Mary the mother of John – the one called Mark – where many had gathered and were praying.
\v 13 When he knocked at the outer gate a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer
\v 14 and, when she recognised Peter’s voice, from sheer joy she did not open the door! – but ran inside and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.
\p
\v 15 They said to her, “You are mad!”, but she insisted that it was so. They said, “It is his angel.”
\v 16 Peter carried on knocking. When they did open the door they saw him and were astonished.
\v 17 But with the hand he signalled to them to be quiet, and he related to them how the Lord had brought him out from the prison, and he said, “Take word of this to James and the brothers and sisters.” Then he left and went to another place.
\p
\v 18 When day dawned there was no small uproar among the soldiers. “Peter! What has become [of him]?”
\v 19 Herod searched for him but did not find [him]. He interrogated the guards and ordered that they be led away. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
\p
\v 20 Herod was in bitter conflict with the Tyrians and Sidonians. In common cause they approached him and, having befriended Blastus the king’s Chamberlain, they sued for peace because their country was provisioned by the king’s [country].
\v 21 On an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in regal apparel, sat upon the throne, and made a speech to them.
\v 22 The citizens shouted, “The voice of a god and not of a human being!”
\v 23 And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give the glory to God. And he became maggot-ridden and gave up the ghost.
\p
\v 24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
\v 25 Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem having fulfilled [their] ministry, and took with them John who was also called Mark.
\p
\c 13
\v 1 Now, some who were in Antioch, in the Church down there, were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who is called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who grew up with Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.
\v 2 They were serving the Lord and fasting when the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me both Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”
\p
\v 3 Then, having fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they sent them off.
\v 4 So having been, in truth, dispatched by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.
\v 5 Arriving in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues, and they had John in attendance.
\v 6 Then, going through the island to Paphos, they found someone who was a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew. His name was Bar-Jesus.
\v 7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man, who invited Barnabas and Saul, wanting to hear the word of God.
\v 8 But Elymas the sorcerer – that is his name in translation – opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
\v 9 Saul – also [known as] Paul – filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at him
\v 10 and said, “Full of all duplicity and everything malign, son of the devil, enemy of everything that is righteous, will you not stop twisting the straight ways of the Lord?
\v 11 But now, understand that the Lord’s hand is upon you. You shall be blind; you shall not see the sun for a time.”
\p Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he began to wander about looking for someone to lead him by the hand.
\v 12 When the proconsul saw what had happened he believed – and was overcome with astonishment by the teaching of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Paul's company, setting sail from Paphos, arrived at Perga in Pamphylia where John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 Then travelling on from Perga they reached Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.
\v 15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets the synagogue rulers sent to them saying, “Men, brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, speak.”
\p
\v 16 So Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand he said, “Men, Israelites, and those who fear God, listen.
\v 17 The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and raised up the people in exile in the land of Egypt. Then, with an uplifted arm he led them out from there,
\v 18 and over a period of about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness.
\v 19 Then having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan he shared out their land among them by lot.  
\v 20 After that, for about four hundred and fifty years, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
\v 21 At that time they asked for a king and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
\v 22 Then, removing him, he raised up for them David as king – and of him he said, he testified, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart who will do all that I desire.’
\v 23 From this man’s offspring, God, according to his promise, has brought salvation to Israel
\v 24 – John having first preached, before his coming, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\v 25 As John was finishing the course he said, ‘Who do you suppose that I am? I am not he – but, look! He is following me! I am not worthy to remove a sandal from [his] feet.’”
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers and sisters, children of the stock of Abraham and those among you who fear God, this message of salvation has been sent to you
\v 27 because those living in Jerusalem and their rulers have ignored this man, and, by condemning him, they have fulfilled the voices of the prophets which are read each Sabbath.
\v 28 Although discovering no capital crime, they asked Pilate to have him put to death.
\v 29 When they had fulfilled everything that had been written about him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in a tomb.
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead,
\v 31 and he was seen for many days by those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are his witnesses to the people.
\v 32 Yes, we are bringing you good news. The promise made to the Fathers has been kept, because God has accomplished this for you, his children, by the resurrection of Jesus.
\v 33 For as it is written in the second Psalm,
\q1 ‘You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.’”\rq Psalms 2:7\rq*
\m
\p
\v 34 “God has raised him from the dead never to be changed by decay, and he has said so in this way, ‘I will give you the true holy endowments of David.’\rq Isaiah 55:3\rq*
\v 35 And futhermore, in another [Psalm] he says, ‘You will not allow your holy one to experience decay.’\rq Psalms 15[16]:10\rq*
\v 36 Now, in the case of David, when his own generation had served God’s purpose, he did fall asleep and was laid beside his ancestors and experienced decay,
\v 37 but in the case of the One whom God raised up, he did not experience decay.”
\p
\v 38 “Therefore, let it be known to you, men, brothers and sisters, that through this man the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed.
\v 39 Yes, from everything which, in the law of Moses, prevents you from being declared righteous, everyone who believes in this man is declared righteous.
\v 40 Watch out, then, that what was spoken by the prophets may not come upon you,
\q1
\v 41 ‘Look, you who show contempt and marvel – and perish,
\q1 for in your days I shall do a deed which you will not believe,
\q1 even though someone should declare [it] to you.’\rq Habakkuk 1:5\rq*
\m
\p
\v 42 When they left the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles begged them to speak to them about these matters on the next Sabbath.
\v 43 When the congregation had been dismissed many of Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas who, in conversation with them, were persuading them to continue in the grace of God.
\v 44 Then, on the next Sabbath, almost the entire city gathered to hear the word of God.
\v 45 But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with jealousy and challenged what was said by Paul, contracticting and vilifying [him].
\p
\v 46 Speaking out with confidence, Paul and Barnabas said, “It was necessary that the word of God should be preached to you first, but since you are rejecting it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, you see that we are turning to the Gentiles
\v 47 – for this is what the Lord has commanded us,
\q1 ‘I have appointed you to be a light for the Gentiles;
\q1 your purpose is salvation – to the ends of the earth.’\rq Isaiah 49:6\rq*
\m
\p
\v 48 Hearing this, the Gentiles rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord, and they believed – all those who had been appointed for eternal life.
\v 49 So the word of the Lord word spread throughout the entire region.
\v 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women, and the principal men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them across their frontiers.
\v 51 So, shaking the dust from their feet against them, they went to Iconium.
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
\p
\c 14
\v 1 In Iconium it happened that, together, they entered the synagogue of the Jews to preach, with the result that a very great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
\v 2 But the unbelieving Jews made a stir and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers and sisters.
\v 3 So they stayed there for some time. They were preaching confidently in the Lord who bore witness to the message of his grace, enabling signs and wonders to happen through their hands.
\v 4 But the city’s population was divided; so some were on the side of the Jews and some on the side of the apostles.
\v 5 Then an initiative arose among both Gentiles and Jews – with their leaders – to turn to violence and stone them.
\v 6 They got to know [about the plot] and fled to the cities of Lycaonia: Lystra and Derbe, and to the country round about;
\v 7 and there they continued to proclaim the Gospel.
\p
\v 8 Now, at Lystra there lived a man with no strength in his feet. He had been lame from his mother’s womb; he had never walked.
\v 9 He was listening to Paul, who was speaking and who, looking directly at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
\v 10 said with a loud voice, “Stand on your feet! Upright!” And he leapt up and began to walk.
\v 11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done they raised their voices in the language of Lycaonia declaring, “The gods have taken human form and have come down to us.”
\v 12 They even started calling Barnabas, Zeus; and Paul, Hermes – because he was the chief speaker.
\v 13 The priest of the [temple of] Zeus which is above their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and, together with the crowds, wanted to sacrifice.
\v 14 Realising this, the apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, shouting
\v 15 and calling out, “Men! Why are you doing this? We are human beings just like you, proclaiming the Gospel to you, to turn away from these useless things to the living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
\v 16 In past generations he let all the nations go their own ways,
\v 17 although he did not leave himself without witness – doing good, giving us showers from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”
\p
\v 18 Even by saying this they could scarcely restrain the crowds from sacrificing to them.
\v 19 Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and, winning over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, supposing him to be dead.
\v 20 With the disciples standing around him, he got up and entered the city. But on the next day he left for Derbe with Barnabas.
\p
\v 21 After preaching the Gospel to that city also, and making many disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch.
\v 22 They bolstered the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to persevere in the faith because through many tribulations we must enter the Kingdom of God.
\v 23 And appointing presbyters for them in every Church, having prayed with fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
\p
\v 24 Then passing through Pisidia they arrived in Pamphylia,
\v 25 and having preached the word in Perga they went down to Attalia.
\v 26 And from there they sailed to Antioch – where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
\v 27 When they arrived they gathered the Church together and reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
\v 28 They stayed there with the disciples for some time.
\p
\c 15
\v 1 Then some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses you can not be saved.”
\v 2 Accordingly, no small controversy and debate took place between them and Paul and Barnabas. So they arranged for Paul and Barnabas and some others among them to go up to the apostles and presbyters in Jerusalem regarding this question.
\v 3 Then, having indeed been sent off by the Church, they were passing through Phoenicia and Samaria relating the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers and sisters.
\v 4 When they reached Jerusalem they were received by the Church and the apostles and the presbyters; and they reported all that God had done with them and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 5 Some of those from the sect of the Pharisees who had believed objected, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and also to command them to keep the law of Moses.”
\p
\v 6 The apostles and the presbyters were assembled to see about this matter.
\v 7 After there had been much discussion Peter got up and said to them, “Men, brothers, you know that some time back God made the decision through us for the Gentiles to hear, through my mouth, the message of the Gospel and to believe;
\v 8 and God who knows the heart testified on their behalf by giving the Holy Spirit to them as well, just as he had to us.
\v 9 Therefore, he made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
\v 10 So why are you now testing God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, one which neither our ancestors nor we had the strength to bear?
\v 11 But, through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we have faith to be saved – just as they do too.”
\p
\v 12 And the whole company was silent. Then they listened to Barnabas and Paul relating the many signs and wonders God had brought about among the Gentiles through them.
\v 13 When they fell silent James responded, saying, “Men, brothers, listen to me.
\v 14 Simeon has reported how God first selected and took from the nations a people for his name.
\v 15 This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After this I shall return and I shall rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I shall rebuild its ruins and restore it
\v 17 so that the rest of humanity may seek out the Lord – all the nations upon whom my name has been invoked, says the Lord who is doing all these things.\rq Amos 9:11-12\rq*
\v 18 Everything he has done from ages past is known to God.’
\m
\v 19 Therefore my own decision is not to trouble further those among the Gentiles who turn to God, 
\v 20 but to write [telling] them to abstain from the defilement of idolatry, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled and from blood.
\v 21 For through generations from antiquity in every town Moses, being read every Sabbath in the synagogues, has had those who preach him.”
\p
\v 22 Then the apostles and the presbyters with the whole Church were minded to send men chosen from among themselves to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, also called Barsabbas, and Silas – men of authority among the brothers and sisters.
\v 23 By their hand they wrote,
\p “The apostles, the presbyters and the brothers and sisters to those in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, the brothers and sisters who are Gentiles, greetings.
\v 24 Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with arguments and unsettled your souls by saying, ‘You must be circumcised and keep the law’ –although they had no such commission from us –
\v 25 we were minded, having come to a unanimous agreement, to choose men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul –
\v 26 men who have surrendered their souls for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 27 Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, and they, through the spoken word, will report these things.
\v 28 For the Holy Spirit and we were minded to impose no greater burden on you than these necessary [rules]:
\v 29 to abstain from what is sacrificed to idols; and from blood; and from what is strangled; and from sexual immorality. Keeping yourselves from these things, you will do well. Be strong!”
\p
\v 30 So they were duly dispatched and arrived in Antioch, and gathering the community together they delivered the letter.
\v 31 Reading it, they were delighted by the encouragement.
\v 32 Judas, and Silas too, being themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers and sisters with many words.
\v 33 Having stayed for some time, they were dispatched with [words of] peace from the brothers and sisters to the apostles.
\v 34 But Silas preferred to stay there.
\v 35 Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch teaching and preaching the Gospel, the word of the Lord, with many others as well.
\p
\v 36 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Suppose we return to our brothers and sisters in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord to see how they are doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas was minded to take John with [them], the one also called Mark.
\v 38 But Paul did not think it appropriate to take with them the one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not kept company with them in the work.
\v 39 So there arose a dispute – so much so that they became separated from one another. Barnabas took Mark with him and set sail for Cyprus;
\v 40 but Paul chose Silas and left, having been entrusted to the grace of God by the brothers and sisters.
\v 41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the Churches.
\p
\c 16
\v 1 He reached Derbe and Lystra and, mark this, a particular disciple named Timothy was there, a son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, and of a Greek father.
\v 2 He was well spoken of by the brothers and sisters in Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 Paul wanted to leave with him, so he took and circumcised him – because of the Jews who were in those places, for everyone knew his father, that he was a Greek.
\v 4 And as they made their way through the cities, they handed down to them the rules to be kept which had been decreed by the apostles and the presbyters in Jerusalem.
\v 5 So the Churches were then firmly established in the faith and were increasing in number day by day.
\p
\v 6 Having passed through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were prevented by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in Asia.
\v 7 They continued in the direction of Mysia, tried to go on to Bithynia but the Spirit did not allow them,
\v 8 so passing through Mysia they came down into Troas.
\v 9 Then, during the night a vision was disclosed to Paul. A man of Macedonia was standing, begging him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and rescue us.”
\v 10 After he had seen the vision, we immediately determined to set out for Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel to them.
\p
\v 11 So, sailing from Troas, we set a course straight to Samothrace. Then on the following day to Neapolis,
\v 12 and from there to Philippi which is a principal city of the province of Macedonia, a [Roman] colony.
\p We stayed there in the city for some days.
\v 13 Then, on the Sabbath day, we went outside the city to a riverside, a usual place for prayer. We sat down and began speaking to the women who had gathered.
\v 14 Listening, was one particular woman, Lydia by name, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, a worshipper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay close attention to what was being said by Paul.
\v 15 Then, when she and her household were baptised, she begged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay in my house.” And she insisted.
\p
\v 16 It happened as we were going to prayer that a slave girl met us. She had a spirit of divination and provided a large profit for her masters by fortune telling.
\v 17 Following Paul and Silas, she was crying out, saying, “These men are servants of the Most High God. They proclaim to us a way of salvation.”
\v 18 And she did this for many days. Then Paul, becoming aggrieved, turned around and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out at that instant.
\v 19 When her masters saw that their expectation of profit was gone they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them before the magistrates in the marketplace.
\v 20 Bringing them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are greatly troubling our city. They are Jews,
\v 21 and they are promoting customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to adopt or to practise.”
\p
\v 22 Then the mob rose up together against them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothes and ordered that they be flogged.
\v 23 When many blows had been inflicted upon them they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely.
\v 24 Receiving such an order, he thrust them into the innermost cell and secured their feet in the stocks.
\p
\v 25 At about midnight Paul and Silas were praying, praising God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 Then suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Instantly, all the doors and everyone’s shackles sprang open.
\v 27 The jailer, waking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
\v 28 But Paul shouted in a loud voice, saying “Do not harm yourself for we are all here.”
\p
\v 29 Calling for lights, he rushed in and fell down trembling in front of Paul and Silas.
\v 30 He brought them out and said, “Masters, what must I do to be saved?”
\p
\v 31 And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved – you and your household.”
\v 32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all those in his house.
\v 33 Then – at that hour of the night – he took them and bathed [their] wounds and was baptised straightaway, he himself and all who were his.
\v 34 And, taking them into his house, he put food on the table and celebrated with the whole family having believed in God.
\p
\v 35 When day came, the magistrates sent the officers to say, “Let those people go.”
\p
\v 36 The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent [word] that you should be released. So, leave now; go in peace.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly without trial. Though we are Romans they have thrown [us] into prison. And now they are throwing us out in secret! Certainly not! Let them come themselves and lead us out.”
\p
\v 38 When the officers reported these words to the magistrates they became fearful, hearing that they were Romans.
\v 39 So they came and pleaded with them; and leading [them] out, they requested [them] to leave the city.
\v 40 Coming out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s [house], and seeing the brothers and sisters, they encouraged them. Then they left.
\p
\c 17
\v 1 Passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica where there was a Jewish synagogue.
\v 2 As was Paul’s custom he joined them, and for three Sabbaths preached to them from the Scriptures
\v 3 explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and to rise again from the dead, and that, “Jesus whom I proclaim to you – this is the Christ.”
\p
\v 4 And some of them were convinced and threw their lot in with Paul and Silas, and also a large number of devout Greeks and not a few of the principal women.
\v 5 But the unbelieving Jews, bringing along some evil fellows off the streets, gathered a mob and set the city in uproar. Besieging the house of Jason they wanted to carry them off to the citizenry,
\v 6 but not finding them they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the magistrates, yelling out, “These people, having turned the world upside down, have come here as well.
\v 7 Jason has given them shelter! They all behave contrary to the decrees of Caesar saying there is a different king, Jesus.”
\v 8 The crowd and the magistrates were troubled when they heard this,
\v 9 but receiving sufficient [security] from Jason and the rest, they released them.
\p
\v 10 The brothers and sisters sent Paul and Silas away at once, during the night, to Beroea. When they arrived they went to the Jewish synagogue.
\p
\v 11 Now, these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica. They received the word with complete readiness of mind, searching the Scriptures daily to see whether those things were so.
\v 12 Consequently many of them then believed, with some of the Greek women of high rank and a good number of men.
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learnt that Paul was also preaching the word of God in Beroea, they, too, went there, inciting the crowds.
\v 14 Then at once the brothers and sisters sent Paul away to proceed with all speed to the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there.
\v 15 Now, those escorting Paul led him as far as Athens. Then, having received instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible, they departed.
\p
\v 16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was moved within him, observing that the city was wholly given over to idolatry.
\v 17 So he began debating in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing, and in the marketplace every day with those whom he happened to meet.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were also falling in with him, and some were saying, “What does this babbler want to say?”
\p and others, “He seems to be an advocate of foreign deities” – because he was proclaiming to them the Gospel of Jesus and the resurrection.
\p
\v 19 They took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what is this new teaching being preached by you?
\v 20 You are bringing to our ears some strange things indeed, so we wish to know what these things are.”
\v 21 Now, all Athenians and the foreigners living there would devote their time to nothing except relating, or listening to, something new.
\p
\v 22 So Paul, standing in the middle of the Areopagus, spoke. “Men! Athenians! I can see that in every respect you are more religious than others.
\v 23 As I passed by, I was observing your objects of worship and I noticed an altar on which was inscribed, ‘To an unknown God’. Now then, the one whom  you worship in ignorance I proclaim to you.
\v 24 The God who made the world and all that is in it, being Lord of heaven and of earth, does not live in shrines of human construction.
\v 25 Neither is he provided for by human hands; needing nothing himself, he gives life and breath – and everything – to everyone.
\v 26 From one blood he has made every nation of men and women to live on the whole face of the earth – having assigned the appointed times and boundaries of their habitation –
\v 27 and to seek the Lord so that perhaps, reaching out for him, they might find him; though he is not far from each one of us,
\v 28 ‘For in him we live and move and exist.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘For we too are born of him.’
\v 29 Since we are God’s offspring we should not think that the Divinity is like gold or silver or stone engraved by human skill and design.
\v 30 God has indeed overlooked times of ignorance, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent,
\v 31 because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world with righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, offering assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”
\p
\v 32 When they heard of a resurrection from the dead some scoffed, it is true, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this matter.”
\p
\v 33 Paul then went out from among them.
\v 34 But some, joining him, believed – among them both Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
\p
\c 18
\v 1 After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth
\v 2 where he found a Jew, Aquila by name, a native of Pontus who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews out of Rome. He visited them,
\v 3 and since they practised the same craft he stayed with them and began working. They were tent-makers by trade.
\v 4 Sabbath by Sabbath he was debating in the synagogue, persuading both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia Paul was wholeheartedly taken up with testifying to the Jews that Jesus [was] the Christ,
\v 6 but they began resisting and insulting [him]. He shook [the dust] from his clothes and told them, “Your blood be upon your [own] head – I am not culpable. From now on I shall go to the Gentiles.”
\p
\v 7 Then, leaving that place, he went to the house of one, Justus by name, a God-fearer, whose house ajoined the synagogue.
\v 8 But Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, did believe in the Lord with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians, when they heard, began to believe and were baptised.
\p
\v 9 The Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak out and do not remain silent,
\v 10 for I am with you; and no one will set upon you to do you harm, for I have many people in this city.”
\v 11 So he stayed for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\p
\v 12 When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia the Jews made a concerted attack upon Paul and brought him before the tribunal,
\v 13 saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God [in a manner] contrary to the law.”
\v 14 As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or some grievous crime, then certainly, within reason, I would bear with you Jews.
\v 15 But if it is a question of doctrine and definitions, and of your own law, see to it yourselves – for I have no desire to be a judge in these matters.”
\v 16 And he drove them from the court.
\v 17 Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and began beating him in the presence of the court, but Gallio did not care about any of this.
\p
\v 18 When Paul had stayed on for a number of days took his leave of the brothers and sisters and set sail for Syria; and with him were Priscilla and Aquila – who had shaved his head in Cenchreae because he had taken a vow.
\v 19 He arrived at Ephesus and left them there, but he himself entered the synagogue and debated with the Jews.
\v 20 When they asked him to stay with them longer, he declined
\v 21 and took his leave of them, saying, “I must above all keep the coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.
\p
\v 22 Then, landing at Caesarea and going up to greet the Church, [Paul] travelled down to Antioch.
\v 23 After staying some time, he left, and methodically made his way through the province of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples.
\p
\v 24 Someone arrived in Ephesus – a Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence, strong on the Scriptures.
\v 25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord and, spiritually on fire, he was speaking and teaching about the Lord, [though] he knew only the baptism of John.
\v 26 So this man began speaking confidently in the synagogue. Then Aquila and Priscilla, hearing about him, took him aside and explained to him more accurately the way of God.
\p
\v 27 He was intending to travel on to Achaia, so the brothers and sisters wrote to the disciples exhorting them to welcome him. Having got there, he did much to help those who had believed through grace,
\v 28 for he began cogently to confound the Jews in public, demonstrating through the Scriptures Jesus to be the Christ.
\p
\c 19
\v 1 What happened was that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul travelled overland to reach Ephesus. He found some disciples
\v 2 and said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
\p They replied, “No, we have never heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
\p
\v 3 Paul asked them, “So into what were you baptised?”
\p They answered, “Into John’s baptism.”
\p
\v 4 Then Paul said, “John indeed baptised with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus Christ.”
\p
\v 5 Hearing this they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus,
\v 6 and when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
\v 7 And the total number of men was twelve.
\p
\v 8 Then he went into the synagogue and, over three months, spoke openly, discussing with them and persuading them about matters concerning the Kingdom of God.
\v 9 But when some became stubborn and disbelieving, reviling the Way to the company, he left them, separating out the disciples, and began debating day by day in the school of one, Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all those living in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
\p
\v 11 God was also performing extraordinary miracles at the hands of Paul
\v 12 to such an extent that even face-towels or cloths that he had touched were taken to the sick, and the illnesses left them and the evil spirits were driven out of them.
\p
\v 13 Some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it on themselves to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, “We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.”
\v 14 Now, there were some – the seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest – who did this.
\v 15 But the evil spirit answered back. It said, “Jesus I know, and I know who Paul is, but who are you?”
\v 16 Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leapt on them and overpowered them, forcing them to flee from that house naked and wounded.
\v 17 This became common knowledge to everyone living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all. Then the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified,
\v 18 and many of those who believed were coming to confess and declare their deeds,
\v 19 and many of those who had practised magic brought their books and were burning them in the sight of all. They calculated their value and found [it to be] fifty thousand pieces of silver.
\v 20 In this way the word of the Lord was becoming greater and stronger.
\p
\v 21 When all this had been accomplished, Paul set his mind on going through Macedonia and Achaia and on to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there I must also see Rome.”
\p
\v 22 Having sent to Macedonia two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed on for a while in Asia.
\v 23 At that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way,
\v 24 because of a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who was making silver shrines of Artemis which provided no small profit for the craftsmen.
\v 25 He convened a meeting and said to those employed in such work, “Men, you know that because of this business we are well off.
\v 26 Yet you see and hear that, not only in Ephesus but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has convinced and turned away a great number of people, saying that the products of [our] hands are not gods.
\v 27 Not only is there a danger for us that this craft will fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be considered of no account, and that the glory of her whom all of Asia and the world revere is going to be destroyed.”
\p
\v 28 When they heard this they became enraged and began shouting out, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.”
\v 29 Then the whole city was filled with confusion and one and all rushed together into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul’s travelling companions.
\v 30 When Paul wanted to go in to the mob the disciples would not allow him,
\v 31 and some of the provincial officials\f 23:3 \ft 'Asiarchs' – high Roman officials in the province of Asia Minor.\f* who were his friends sent word to him, begging him not to show himself in the theatre.
\v 32 In truth, some were shouting one thing and others another, for the assembly was in disorder and the majority did not know why they had gathered.
\v 33 Out from the crowd they thrust Alexander forward – the Jews pushed him to the front – and Alexander signalled with his hand, wishing to make a defence to the people.
\v 34 But when they realised that he was a Jew, for about two hours they were all yelling out in unison, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.”
\p
\v 35 When the municipal administrator had quelled the crowd he said, “Men of Ephesus, where is the person who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the dedicated guardian of the great goddess Artemis and of what fell from heaven?
\v 36 Since these things are undeniable you ought to be quiet and do nothing impetuously,
\v 37 for you have brought in these men who are neither despoilers of the temple nor blasphemers of your goddess.
\v 38 Therefore, if indeed Demetrius and the craftsmen do have a case against anyone, court-days are held and there are proconsuls. Let them lay charges against one another.
\v 39 And if you are looking for [justice] about other matters, it will be settled in lawful assembly.
\v 40 For we are even in danger of being accused of insurrection concerning this day’s [events] since there is no reason that we can offer as an explanation for this unruly gathering.”
\v 41 Having said this, he dismissed the assembly.
\p
\c 20
\v 1 When the disturbance came to an end Paul summoned the disciples, embraced them, and left for Macedonia.
\v 2 Travelling through that region, he encouraged the [believers] with many words and arrived in Greece.
\v 3 But after he had been there for three months, the Jews began plotting against him. Being about to set out for Syria, it occurred to him to return through Macedonia.
\v 4 Accompanying him as far as Asia were Sopater of Beroea, the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
\v 5 They went on ahead and waited for us in Troas.
\v 6 Then, after the days of Unleavened Bread, we set sail from Philippi; and five days later we met them at Troas where we stayed for seven days.
\p
\v 7 On the first day of the week the disciples had come together to break bread. Paul, intending to leave the following day, preached to them. He continued preaching until midnight.
\v 8 There were quite a few oil lamps in the upper room where we were meeting
\v 9 and there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window, sinking into a deep sleep. As Paul preached on and on, the young man, slumped in sleep, fell right down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down, fell upon on him and took him in his arms, saying, “Do not be dismayed, for his breath is in him.”
\p
\v 11 Going upstairs, he broke bread and ate; and engaged in conversation for a long while – until daybreak – and after that he departed.
\v 12 Then they took the lad away alive, and not a little comforted.
\p
\v 13 We had gone on ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, expecting to pick up Paul there, as he had arranged, intending to make his own way on foot.
\v 14 And when he met up with us in Assos, we took him on board and went on to Mitylene.
\v 15 The following day we sailed on from there and arrived off Chios, and the day after we reached Samos. Then, having stayed in Trogyllium, next we arrived in Miletus.
\v 16 Paul decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not lose time in Asia, for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if it were possible for him, by the day of Pentecost.
\p
\v 17 So from Miletus he sent to Ephesus summoning the presbyters of the Church.
\v 18 When they reached him he told them, “You yourselves know how, from the first day I set foot in Asia, I was with you all the time.
\v 19 I have served the Lord with all humility and many tears; I have met with trials on account of the plots of the Jews against me.
\v 20 In speaking to you I have held back nothing that was profitable, teaching you in public and at home,
\v 21 testifying to both Jews and Greeks about turning in repentence to God and believing in our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 22 But now, listen: I am bound by the Spirit to go on to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there
\v 23 – except that in every city the Holy Spirit testifies, saying that chains and afflictions await me.
\v 24 But I do not take into account of any of these things, neither do I hold my life dear to myself, in order that with joy I might finish my race and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to bear witness to the Gospel of the grace of God.”
\p
\v 25 “But now, listen: I know that you will not see my face again – none of you with whom I have travelled, preaching the Kingdom of God.
\v 26 This is why I am calling you as witnesses that I bear no guilt for anyone’s blood all,
\v 27 for I have not held back from proclaiming to you the whole counsel of God.
\v 28 Therefore be attentive to yourselves and to the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you bishops. Shepherd the Church of [our] Lord and God which he has purchased with his own blood,
\v 29 for I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you. They will not spare the flock.
\v 30 And from among yourselves men will arise preaching perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.
\v 31 For this reason be vigilant, being mindful that for three years, night and day, I did not cease warning each one [of you] with tears.
\v 32 And now, brothers, I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace which has power to build up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
\v 33 I coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothes.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my needs and to [the needs] of those who were with me.
\v 35 I showed you all this because it is necessary by labouring in this way to support the weak. Remember also the words of the Lord Jesus. As he himself said, it is more blessed to give than to receive.”
\p
\v 36 Having said this, he knelt down with them all and prayed.
\v 37 Then there was much weeping by everyone, and falling on Paul’s neck they kissed him,
\v 38 being sorrowful most of all because of what he had said – that they would probably not see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
\p
\c 21
\v 1 We sailed away leaving them behind. Setting a straight course we arrived at Cos, then on the next day at Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
\v 2 Finding a ship bound for Phoenicia, we embarked and set sail.
\v 3 Cyprus came into view; we left it to port, sailed on towards Syria and landed at Tyre – for there the ship was to unload the cargo.
\v 4 Discovering disciples there, we stayed for seven days, and through the Spirit they told Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 5 When the time came to an end we left and went on our way. Everyone – including women and children – escorted us until [we were] out of the city. Then we knelt on the shore and prayed.
\v 6 When we had embraced one another, we boarded the ship and they returned home.
\p
\v 7 Completing the voyage from Tyre, we reached Ptolemais and, having greeted the brothers and sisters, we spent one day with them.
\v 8 Leaving the following day, we arrived in Caesarea and went to the house of Philip the evangelist who is one of the Seven. We stayed with him.
\v 9 This man had four unmarried daughters who prophesied,
\v 10 and we remained there for a number of days. Someone came down from Judea, a prophet named Agabus,
\v 11 and coming to us he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands. He said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says, ‘The man whose belt this is, the Jews in Jerusalem will likewise bind, and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’”
\p
\v 12 Now when we heard these things we, and those who were there, begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 But Paul answered, “What are you doing? Sobbing and breaking my heart! Of course I am ready – not only to be in bonds but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
\p
\v 14 Since he was not to be persuaded we held our peace, saying, “The Lord’s will be done.”
\p
\v 15 After this we packed up and began making our way up to Jerusalem.
\v 16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing with them an early disciple – one, Mnason of Cyprus – with whom we were to lodge.
\p
\v 17 When we arrived in Jerusalem the brothers and sisters welcomed us gladly.
\v 18 On the following day Paul went with us to visit James – and all the presbyters were present –
\v 19 and having greeted them, he reported every single thing that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
\v 20 When they had listened they began glorifying God. Then they told him, “You see, brother, there are many thousands of Jews who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.
\v 21 They have heard about you – that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise the children nor to follow the customs.
\v 22 What then? A huge congregation will most certainly gather because they will hear that you have arrived.
\v 23 So do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.
\v 24 Join them; be purifified with them; and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing in what they have heard about you, but that you yourself also live by observing the law.
\v 25 But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and have given judgement that they should do none of this – except preserve themselves from meat offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and sexual immorality.”
\p
\v 26 Then, on the following day, Paul accompanied the men. Having purified himself with them, he went into the temple to give notice of the period until the purification was complete when the offering would be made on behalf of each one of them.
\v 27 But when the seven days were about to come to an end Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, began stirring up the entire crowd. They laid hands on him,
\v 28 shouting, “Men! Israelites! Help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere in opposition to the people and the law and this place. He has even brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.”
\v 29 This was because they had noticed him in the city with Trophimus the Ephesian whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.
\p
\v 30 The whole city was roused and the people came running, and seizing Paul they were dragging him out of the temple. Then the doors were quickly shut.
\v 31 While they were trying to kill him a report went up to the commander of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in uproar.
\v 32 Immediately, taking soldiers and centurions, he bore down upon them; and they, seeing the commander and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.
\v 33 The commanding officer came up, arrested him, and gave orders for [him] to be bound with two chains. Then he began inquiring who he was and what he had been doing.
\v 34 Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, and some another. Because of the uproar he could not gain a clear understaning, so he ordered him to be taken to the barracks.
\v 35 When he reached the steps he was carried up by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,
\v 36 for the whole mob was following, shouting, “Put him away!”
\v 37 As Paul was about to be led into the barracks he said to the commanding officer, “May I say something to you?”
\p The man replied, “Do you know Greek?
\v 38 So you are not the Egyptian who caused trouble some time ago and led the four thousand murderous outlaws into the desert?”
\p
\v 39 Paul replied, “I am a man who is a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city not without importance. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”
\p
\v 40 He gave him permission and Paul, standing on the steps, quietened the people with [his] hand. When there was complete silence, he addressed them in Aramaic, saying,
\p
\c 22
\v 1 “Men, brothers and fathers, now listen to my defence to you.”
\p
\v 2 When they heard that he was speaking to them in Aramaic they became even quieter, and he affirmed,
\v 3 “I am in fact a Jewish man. I was born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel. I have been instructed in meticulous detail in the law of the fathers. I am zealous for God – just as all of you are today.
\v 4 I persecuted this Way to the death, arresting and committing to prison both men and women,
\v 5 as the High Priest and the entire council of elders will testify for me. And from them I received letters for the brothers in Damascus, and set out to bring those there also to Jerusalem in chains so they might be punished.
\v 6 Suddenly, at about midday as I was travelling and approaching Damascus, a great light from heaven shone around me.
\v 7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
\v 8 I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I, whom you are persecuting, am Jesus of Nazareth.’
\p
\v 9 Those who were with me actually saw the light and were terrified, but they did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.
\v 10 I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything that has been appointed for you to do.’
\v 11 As I could not see – because of the radiance of that light – I arrived in Damascus being led by the hand by those who were with me.
\v 12 A certain man – Ananias – devout with respect to the law, well-spoken of by all the Jews living in Damascus,
\v 13 came to me and stood there, saying to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’ And at that moment I saw him.
\v 14 then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has already chosen you to know his will – and to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of his voice.
\v 15 For you are to be a witness for him to all people of what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 So now, why delay? Arise! Be baptised and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.’
\p
\v 17 When I returned to Jerusalem, while I was praying in the temple this happened. I fell into a trance,
\v 18 and I saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry up and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’
\v 19 And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you.
\v 20 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was being shed, I too was present, consenting to his death and looking after the coats of those who were killing him.’
\p
\v 21 Then he said to me, ‘Go! For I will send you to distant nations.’”
\p
\v 22 Until he said that they had listened to him; then they raised a shout, crying, “Rid the earth of his sort, for he is not fit to live.”
\p
\v 23 They were screaming and flinging off their coats and throwing dust into the air.
\v 24 The commanding officer ordered that he be brought into the barracks, saying, “Let him be interrogated by scourging” – so that he might discover for what crime they were yelling at him like that.
\v 25 As they stretched him out with leather straps Paul asked the centurion present, “Is it lawful for you to flog a person, a Roman [citizen], without trial?”
\p
\v 26 When the centurion heard [this], he approached the commanding officer and reported, saying, “Mind what you are about to do, because this man is a Roman.”
\p
\v 27 The commanding officer came and asked him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?”
\p and he said, “Yes.”
\p
\v 28 Then the commanding officer responded, “I, at great cost, bought this citizenship.”
\p And Paul declared, “Yes, but I was born a Roman.”
\p
\v 29 Then, immediately, those who were about to interrogate him left him; and the commanding officer, too, was afraid when he learnt that he was a Roman, and because he had tied him up.
\v 30 So on the following day, wanting to know for certain of what he was being accused by the Jews, he released him from the shackles and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to attend. Bringing Paul down, he set him before them.
\p
\c 23
\v 1 Paul, looking directly at the Sanhedrin, said, “Men, brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience right up to this day.”
\v 2 Then the High Priest, Ananias, ordered those standing beside him to beat him about the mouth.
\p
\v 3 But Paul said to him, “God needs to thump you, you whitewashed wall! And you – you sit judging me according to the law, yet, in breach of the law, you order me to be beaten!”
\p
\v 4 Those standing by said, “Would you insult God’s High Priest?”,
\p
\v 5 And Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he is the High Priest, for it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’\rq Exodus 22:28\rq*”
\v 6 Now when Paul realised that one element were Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out in the Sanhedrin, “Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, a son of a Pharisee. I am being judged concerning hope, and the resurrection of the dead.”
\p
\v 7 When he spoke of this a controversy arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
\v 8 For Sadducees, on the one hand, say there is no resurrection – nor angels or spirits; on the other hand, Pharisees acknowledge them all.
\v 9 A great row ensued with the scribes of the Pharisees’ party standing up to do battle, declaring, “We find no evil in this man. If a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.”
\p
\v 10 The uproar became so great that the commander, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the troops to go down and use force to remove him from among them and to bring him into the barracks.
\p
\v 11 On the following night the Lord stood by him and said, “Courage, Paul, for as you have testified about me in Jerusalem so, in the same way, you must bear witness in Rome as well.”
\p
\v 12 When day came some of the Jews made a pact, put themselves on oath, saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
\v 13 There were more than forty who were committed to this conspiracy.
\v 14 They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have put ourselves under a ban with an oath to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
\v 15 Now you, therefore, with the Sanhedrin are to inform the commanding officer that tomorrow he should to bring him down to you – as though you were going to inquire more closely into the matters which concern him – and we are prepared to kill him before he arrives.”
\p
\v 16 But Paul’s sister’s son, hearing of the ambush, arrived at the barracks, went in and told Paul.
\v 17 Calling one of the centurions, Paul said, “Conduct this young man to the commanding officer because he has something to tell him.”
\p
\v 18 So, taking him, he did indeed bring him to the commanding officer, saying, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you.”
\p
\v 19 The commanding officer took him by the hand, and withdrawing in private he enquired, “What is it that you have to tell me?”
\p
\v 20 He replied, “The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire about him somewhat more thoroughly.
\v 21 But you should not accede to their request, for lying in wait for him are more than forty men who have put themselves under oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Even now they are ready, waiting for the undertaking from you.”
\p
\v 22 So then the commanding officer let the young man go, having ordered him to ‘tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.’
\v 23 And summoning two of the centurions he said, “Make ready two hundred soldiers to proceed to Caesarea at the third hour of the night – with cavalry: seventy; and spearmen: two hundred.
\v 24 Also make provision for beasts to mount Paul in order to convey him in safety to Felix the governor.”
\v 25 He wrote a letter in this style:
\p
\v 26 “Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix.
\p Greeting!
\p
\v 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I arrived with troops and rescued him. I learnt that he was a Roman,
\v 28 and wanting to know the crime of which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin.
\v 29 I found him to be accused with respect to questions of their law, but they made no accusation worthy of death or imprisonment.
\v 30 When an imminent ambush by the Jews against the man was disclosed to me I immediately despatched him to you. I have also instructed the accusers to lay before you the [charges] against him.
\p Farewell.”
\p
\v 31 So then, the soldiers, as they had been directed, took Paul and brought him through the night to Antipatris.
\v 32 Then, on the following day, they allowed the cavalry to remain with him and returned to barracks.
\v 33 When they had entered Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul to him.
\v 34 Having read [the letter], he then enquired what province he was from and learnt that he was from Cilicia.
\v 35 “I will hear from you”, he declared, “when your accusers have also arrived.” And he ordered him to be held in Herod’s praetorium.
\p
\c 24
\v 1 Five days later the High Priest, Ananias, came down with the elders and an advocate, one Tertullus, and they made their presentation to the governor against Paul.
\v 2 When he had been called, Tertullus began to prosecute, saying,
\v 3 “We enjoy great peace because of you, and good administration through your provident care for this nation. Always and everywhere we welcome this, Most Excellent Felix, with great gratitude.
\v 4 So that I do not detain you at length, I entreat you of your goodness to listen us briefly.
\v 5 For we have found this man a pestilence and an instigator of insurrection to all Jews throughout the world, and also a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
\v 6 He even tried to desecrate the temple, but we arrested him, wanting to prosecute him in accordance with our law.
\v 7 However, Lysias, the commanding officer, arrived in force and took him out of our hands,
\v 8 ordering his accusers to appear before you. When you have questioned him yourself you will be able to comprehend all these things of which we are accusing him.”
\p
\v 9 And the Jews concurred, affirming these things to be so.
\v 10 Then, when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul responded, “Knowing that for many years you have been judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defence.
\v 11 You can be assured that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
\v 12 And not in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city did they find me arguing with anyone or rabble-rousing.
\v 13 Nor are they able to substantiate the charges they are now bringing against me.
\v 14 But I do admit this to you, that I worship the God of our ancestors according to the Way – which they call a sect – believing everything, in accordance with the law, that has been written in the prophets.
\v 15 I have a hope in God, which they themselves accept, that there is going to be a resurrection of the dead, both righteous and unrighteous.
\v 16 And because of this I strive in every way to have a clear conscience towards God and [other] people.
\v 17 After many years I came to give alms to my people and to make offerings.
\v 18 This is how some Jews from Asia found me in the temple, ritually purified, with no mob nor with any disorder. 
\v 19 They ought to be here before you and be bringing charges, if they have anything against me.
\v 20 Otherwise, let these men say whether, when I appeared before the Sanhedrin, they found any wrong-doing in me
\v 21 – except for this one statement I voiced aloud, standing among them, ‘In connection with the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today.’”
\p
\v 22 After listening to all this Felix adjourned the proceedings, having become better informed of matters concerning the Way. He said, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down I will learn more about you.”
\p
\v 23 He arranged with the centurion to detain Paul – but [for him] to have some liberty – and to forbid none of his own friends from serving or visiting him.
\v 24 A few days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him on the subject of faith in Christ.
\v 25 As he spoke about righteousness and self-control and the judgement to come, Felix became afraid and said, “Leave, now. When I have an opportunity I will send for you.”
\v 26 At the same time he was also hoping that he would be offered money by Paul, to release him. For this reason too he sent for him more often and would converse with him.
\v 27 Then, when two years had elapsed, Felix had a successor – Porcius Festus. Now, Felix, wanting to bestow a favour upon the Jews, left Paul in custody.
\p
\c 25
\v 1 Then, three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea,
\v 2 and the High Priest and the leaders of the Jews informed him about Paul and began petitioning him,
\v 3 begging a favour concerning him: that he might summon him to Jerusalem. They were arranging an ambush to kill him on the way.
\v 4 However, Festus replied that Paul would be detained in Caesarea, and that he himself would leave soon.
\v 5 “So those who can” he said, “should come down with me – and whoever is against this man, let them bring charges against him.”
\p
\v 6 Having remained with them for more than ten days, he then went down to Caesarea. The following day, sitting in judgement, he ordered that Paul be brought up.
\v 7 When he appeared the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and laid against Paul many weighty charges which they were not able to substantiate.
\v 8 He made his defence. “Not with respect to the Jewish law, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I transgressed in any way.”
\p
\v 9 Then Festus, wanting to bestow a favour upon the Jews, said in response to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be judged by me pertaining to these matters?”
\p
\v 10 But Paul replied, “I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal – where I should be tried. I have done the Jews no wrong, as you very well know.
\v 11 If I have indeed offended and done something worthy of death, I am not unwilling to die. But if there is nothing in any of the things of which they accuse me, then no one has the power to use me as a favour to them. I appeal to Caesar.”
\p
\v 12 At this, having conferred with counsel, Festus pronounced, “To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.”
\p
\v 13 A few days went by, then King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, being welcomed by Festus.
\v 14 Since they were staying there some days, Festus put the matter of Paul to the king, saying, “There is a someone, a prisoner, left behind by Felix,
\v 15 against whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid information, demanding a conviction against him.
\v 16 I told them that it is not the custom of the Romans to humour anyone by damning a man before the accused has faced the accusers and been offered the opportunity of defending himself concerning the accusation.
\v 17 So having reached this point I did not delay. The very next day they came together.  I took my place on the rostrum and commanded the man to be brought,
\v 18 against whom the plaintiffs, having risen, brought none of the charges which I had imagined.
\v 19 But they had some questions against him concerning their own religion, and about one, Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul was insisting is alive.
\v 20 I was at a loss concerning this inquiry, and asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and to be tried there on these [charges].
\v 21 But Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of Augustus. So I ordered him to be detained until I send him to Caesar.”
\p
\v 22 Agrippa said to Festus, “I, too, should like to hear this man.”
\p  He replied, “Tomorrow you shall hear him.”
\p
\v 23 So, on the following day when Agrippa and Bernice had appeared with great ceremony and had entered the audience-chamber with the commanding officers and the prominent men of the city, Festus gave the order, and Paul was brought in.
\v 24 Then Festus spoke. “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man? The entire Jewish population, both in Jerusalem and here, have lobbied me about him, demanding that he should no longer live.
\v 25 But I found that he had committed nothing deserving death, and when he himself appealed to Augustus I decided to send him.
\v 26 I have nothing of substance to write to the sovereign about him, which is why I have brought him out before you – and especially before you, King Agrippa – so that when the investigation has been concluded I might have something to write.
\v 27 For it seems to me illogical to transfer a prisoner without also indicating the charges against him.”
\p
\c 26
\v 1 Agrippa said to Paul, “You may speak for yourself.”
\p Then Paul spread out his hands and began making his defence.
\v 2 “Regarding everything of which I am accused by the Jews I consider myself blessed, King Agrippa, that today I am about to make my defence before you 
\v 3 – above all because you are an authority on both the customs and quests of the Jews. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me with patience.
\p
\v 4 All the Jews know about my way of life, even from youth, which, from the first, was among my people in Jerusalem.
\v 5 Knowing me from the beginning, they could testify if they were willing that I lived as a Pharisee in accordance with the strictest sect of our religion.
\v 6 And now I stand accused because of a hope concerning the promise made by God to the fathers,
\v 7 [the promise] which our twelve tribes, zealously worshipping night and day, hope will be fulfilled. On account of this hope, King Agrippa, I am being accused by the Jews.
\v 8 Why is it considered incredible to you that God raises the dead?
\p
\v 9 Even so, I myself thought that I ought to act strongly against the name of Jesus of Nazareth
\v 10 – which I did in Jerusalem, imprisoning many of the saints, having received authority from the chief priests. When they were being put to death I cast my vote against them;
\v 11 and in every synagogue I was constantly punishing them, forcing them to blaspheme. Raging fanatically against them, I used to persue them even to foreign cities.”
\p
\v 12 “While doing this I was travelling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests.
\v 13 At midday on the road, your majesty, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those travelling with me.
\v 14 We all fell to the ground. I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’
\p
\v 15 I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’,
\p and he replied, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting;
\v 16 but rise and stand on your feet, for this is why I have appeared to you, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of what you have seen and of what I will reveal to you.
\v 17 Choosing you from among [my] people and the Gentiles, I am sending you to them,
\v 18 to open their eyes, to turn [them] from darkness to light and from the jurisdiction of Satan to God; and to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in me.’
\p
\v 19 From that moment, King Agrippa, I have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but to those in Damascus first, then to those in Jerusalem and the whole territory of Judea, and to the Gentiles, I have been proclaiming [a call] to repent, and to turn back to God by performing deeds appropriate for repentance.
\v 21 This is why the Jews seized me in the temple and were trying to kill me.
\v 22 But having enjoyed God’s help right up to this day, I have continued bearing witness to humble and great alike, saying nothing other than what both the prophets and Moses said would happen
\v 23 – that the Christ was to suffer and how, by first rising from the dead, he was going to proclaim light, both to the Jews and to the Gentiles.”
\p
\v 24 As he was making this defence, Festus protested loudly, “Paul, you are raving! Too much learning is turning you insane.”
\p
\v 25 He maintained, “I am not insane, Most Excellent Festus, but speaking plainly about matters of truth and good sense.
\v 26 Indeed, the king before whom I am speaking with confidence is aware of these things; I am convinced that none of this is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.
\v 27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe!”
\p
\v 28 And Agrippa said to Paul, “Before long you will be persuading me to become a Christian!”
\p
\v 29 Paul replied, “I wish to God that, whether in a little while or in the long term, not only you but all of those who are listening to me this day might also become as I am – except for these chains.”
\p
\v 30 After he had said this, the king rose, with the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.
\v 31 When they had withdrawn, they began talking among themselves, saying, “This man has done nothing deserving death or imprisonment.”
\v 32 Agrippa said to Festus, “This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
\p
\c 27
\v 1 When it had been decided that we should set sail for Italy they committed Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan cohort.
\v 2 Embarking on a ship from Adramyttium about to sail to places throughout Asia, we put to sea. With us was Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
\v 3 The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius, treating Paul with courtesy, permitted him to go off to friends to enjoy [their] hospitality.
\v 4 Setting out from there, we sailed in the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
\v 5 Sailing in deep water off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
\v 6 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria bound for Italy and put us on it.
\v 7 After a good few days, sailing slowly and with difficulty, we arrived off Cnidus. The wind was preventing us from making further headway, so we sailed into the lee of Crete, off Salmone.
\v 8 Then, passing it with difficulty, we arrived at some place called Fair Havens which is near the town of Lasaia.
\p
\v 9 So much time had elapsed that sailing was now dangerous – because even the Fast [for the Day of Atonement] was already over. Paul offered advice,
\v 10 saying to them, “Men, I can see that the voyage is about to be [one] of losses and great detriment to, not only the cargo and the ship, but also our lives.”
\v 11 But the centurion was being won over by the master and the shipowner rather than by what Paul was saying.
\v 12 Since the harbour was ill-suited for overwintering, the majority devised a plan to sail on, so that from there, perhaps, somehow, they might be able to reach Phoenix – a harbour in Crete which looks to the south-west and to the north-west – to overwinter.
\p
\v 13 With a gentle south wind blowing they supposed the objective was in their hand. Weighing anchor, they set their course close to the Crete shore,
\v 14 but not long afterwards a storm-force wind called ‘The Levanter’\f + \fr 27.14\ft The Greek ‘Euroclydon’, a north-easter.\f* struck her.
\v 15 The ship was caught up and, not being able to turn into the wind, we gave her up and were carried away.
\v 16 Running into the lee of one small island called Clauda, we just had the strength to get control of the ship’s tender.
\v 17 Launching it, they deployed cables to undergird the ship, fearing they might be driven onto the shoals of Syrtis. Having reefed the sail, we were carried along in that manner.
\v 18 We were being violently storm-tossed, so the following day they began throwing out the cargo;
\v 19 and on the third day, with our own hands, we flung the ship’s tackle overboard.
\v 20 With neither sun nor stars appearing over many days and with no small storm beating upon us, from then on all hope of our being saved was gone,
\p
\v 21 and for a long while they went without food. Then Paul stood among them and said, “Men, you really should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and thus avoided this loss and damage.
\v 22 But now, I beg you, be cheerful, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\v 23 For last night an angel of the God whose I am, and whom I worship, stood beside me,
\v 24 saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar, and behold! God has granted to you all those sailing with you.’
\v 25 So, men, be cheerful! For I believe God, that it will be just as I have been told.
\v 26 But we must be cast up on some island.”
\p
\v 27 Then, when the fourteenth night came – we were being tossed around in the Adriatic – at about midnight the sailors suspected that they were approaching land,
\v 28 and taking a sounding they got twenty fathoms\f + \fr 27.28\ft A fathom is approximately 1.8 metres.\f*. Then a little later they swung the lead again and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 Fearing we would run aground on reefs, they let out four anchors from the stern, praying for day to dawn.
\v 30 The sailors, wanting to abandon ship, lowered the ship’s tender into the sea, pretending that they intended to lay out anchors from the bow.
\v 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, “Unless these men remain in the ship you can not be saved.”
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut the tender’s lines and let it fall.
\p
\v 33 Right up until day was about to dawn, Paul continued persuading everyone to eat, saying, “For fourteen days, waiting for this day, you have continued to fast, eating nothing.
\v 34 Therefore, I urge you – accept some nourishment. This is for your safety, for not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.”
\v 35 Saying this, he took bread, gave thanks to God in the sight of everyone, broke [it] and began to eat.
\v 36 Then everyone became cheerful and they themselves had something to eat.
\v 37 On the ship we were, in all, two hundred and seventy-six souls.
\v 38 Having eaten their fill, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat overboard into the sea.
\v 39 When day came they did not recognise the land, but observed one particular cove which had a beach, into which they resolved to drive the ship if they could.
\v 40 Then letting go the anchors, they abandoned them in the sea. At the same time, unlashing the tiller and hoisting the mainsail to the wind, they made for the shore.
\v 41 But, falling foul of an area of cross-currents, they ran the vessel aground. And indeed the prow stuck fast and remained immovable while the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.
\p
\v 42 The soldiers were of the opinion that they should kill the prisoners so that no one could escape by swimming away,
\v 43 but the centurion, wanting to save Paul, prevented them from doing so. He ordered those able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get ashore,
\v 44 then the rest – some on spars, some on items from the ship. And so it was that they all reached the shore safely.
\p
\c 28
\v 1 They were saved! And then they learnt that the island was called Malta.
\v 2 The natives showed us no little kindness, for they welcomed us all, kindling a fire because of the continuing rain and because of the cold.
\v 3 As Paul was gathering up a bundle of firewood to put on the fire, a viper emerged – because of the heat – and clung to his hand.
\v 4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand they said one to another, “Surely this man is a murderer. Having escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.”
\v 5 Although, having shaken the creature off into the fire, he felt no ill-effects,
\v 6 they nevertheless were expecting him to swell up at any moment or suddenly to drop down dead. But, waiting a long time and seeing nothing strange happening to him, they changed their minds. They said he was a god.
\p
\v 7 Now near that place were the grounds of the principal man of the island named Publius who welcomed us and courteously put us up for three days.
\v 8 It happened that Publius’ father was laid up, afflicted with fever and dysentery. Paul went in and prayed and, laying hands on him, healed him.
\v 9 After this had happened the others in the island who had diseases also came, and they were healed.
\v 10 Then they honoured us in many ways, and on our departure they provided what was needed.
\p
\v 11 Three months later we set sail in a ship of Alexandria with the figurehead ‘The Sons of Zeus’\f + \fr 28.11\ft The Greek ‘Dioscuri’– the twin sons of Zeus, i.e. Castor and Pollux.\f* which had overwintered in the island.
\v 12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed three days.
\v 13 From there, circling around, we arrived at Rhegium and one day later a south wind sprang up. On the second day we reached Puteoli
\v 14 where we found brothers and sisters and were invited to stay with them for seven days. Then after that we made our way to Rome
\v 15 from where, hearing about us, the brothers and sisters came out to meet us as far as the Appian Forum and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them he gave thanks to God and took courage.
\v 16 When we reached Rome the centurion handed over the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.
\p
\v 17 Three days later, Paul called together those who were prominent among the Jews. When they had assembled he said to them, “Men, brothers, I, who have done nothing against [our] people or the customs of [our] ancestors, am a prisoner from Jerusalem, betrayed into the hands of the Romans.
\v 18 Having questioned me, they wanted to release me because there was no fault in me [worthy] of death.
\v 19 But when the Jews objected I was forced to appeal to Caesar – not that I had any accusation to make against my nation.
\v 20 So this is the reason I asked to see you and to talk, for it is because of the hope of Israel that I am shackled with this chain.”
\p
\v 21 They told him, “We have received no letters from Judea concerning you, nor has any brother arrived reporting or mentioning anything discreditable about you.
\v 22 But we think it is worth hearing from you what is in your mind, because we are aware that everywhere this sect is spoken against.”
\p
\v 23 Having made an appointment with him for a particular day, they began coming – many more of them – to [his] lodgings. From dawn until dusk he was expounding, both from the Law of Moses and from the prophets, testifying earnestly about the Kingdom of God and convincing them of things concerning Jesus.
\v 24 Now some did indeed believe what was said, but others did not.
\v 25 Then, disagreeing with one another, they began to leave. Paul said one [final] thing. “How well the Holy Spirit spoke through Isaiah the prophet to our ancestors,
\v 26 saying,
\q1 ‘Go to this people and say:
\q1 You will listen to what you are hearing but never understand;
\q1 you will look at what you are seeing but never perceive;
\q1
\v 27 for the heart of this people has grown fat
\q1 and their ears are hard of hearing
\q1 and their eyes they have closed,
\q1 fearing they might see with their eyes
\q1 and hear with their ears
\q1 and understand with their heart,
\q1 and might turn again.
\q1 Then I will heal them.’\rq Isaiah 6:9-10\rq*
\m
\p
\v 28 Therefore you should know that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.”
\p
\v 29 When Paul had said this the Jews departed, arguing fiercely among themselves.
\p
\v 30 Paul remained for two whole years in his own rented [accommodation], receiving all who were coming to him,
\v 31 proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with total confidence, without restraint.
