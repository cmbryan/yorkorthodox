\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
\v 2 He was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 Everything came to be through him, and nothing that exists came into being without him.
\v 4 In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of all people.
\v 5 The Light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overpowered it.
\p
\v 6 There came a man sent from God whose name was John.
\v 7 He came as a witness to testify to the Light so that everyone may believe through him.
\v 8 That man was not the Light, but he was to testify to the Light.
\p
\v 9 The true Light who enlightens every person was coming into the world.
\v 10 He was in the world and the world came to be through him, but the world did not recognise him.
\v 11 He came to his own, but his own people did not accept him.
\v 12 But to all who did accept him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the power to become children of God.
\v 13 They were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a man, but of God.
\p
\v 14 The Word became flesh and settled among us, and we looked upon his glory, glory as of the only one born of the Father, full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John testified to him when he cried out, saying, ‘This is he of whom I said, “He who comes after me ranks before me because he existed before me.”’
\p
\v 16 From his plenty we have all received grace upon grace.
\v 17 Although the law was given through Moses, grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No one has ever seen God. It is the one and only Son who is in the bosom of the Father who has made him known.
\p
\v 19 Now this is the testimony of John. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, ‘Who are you?’
\v 20 he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, ‘I am not the Christ.’
\p
\v 21 They asked him, ‘What then? Are you Elijah?’
\p And he said, ‘I am not.’
\p ‘Are you the prophet?’
\p But he answered, ‘No.’
\p
\v 22 Then they said to him, ‘Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?’
\p
\v 23 He said, ‘I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Make straight the way of the Lord,” as Isaiah the prophet said.’\rq Isaiah 40:3\rq*
\p
\v 24 They had been sent from the Pharisees
\v 25 and they questioned him, and asked him, ‘Why then are you baptising if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?’
\p
\v 26 In reply, John told them, ‘I am baptising with water, but among you stands someone you do not know.
\v 27 It is he who comes after me, who existed before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.’
\p
\v 28 These things took place at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.
\p
\v 29 On the following day John saw Jesus approaching him and said, ‘You see the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, “After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he existed before me.”
\v 31 I did not know him, but the reason that I have come baptising with water is so that he may be revealed to Israel.’
\v 32 Then John testified, saying, ‘I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it rested upon him.
\v 33 I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptise with water told me, “The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and resting, this is he who baptises with the Holy Spirit.”
\v 34 And I have seen and I have testified that this is the Son of God.’
\p
\v 35 Again on the following day John was standing with two of his disciples.
\v 36 He watched Jesus walking by and said, ‘You see the Lamb of God.’
\v 37 The two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus.
\p
\v 38 Turning and seeing them following, Jesus asked them, ‘What do you want?’
\p They said to him, ‘Rabbi,’ which means Teacher, ‘where are you staying?’
\p
\v 39 He told them, ‘Come and see.’
\p They went and saw where he was staying and remained with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
\p
\v 40 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.
\v 41 He first found his own brother Simon and told him, ‘We have found the Messiah,’ which means the Anointed\f + \fr 1:41 \ft Or ‘Christ’. The Greek is Christos.\f*.
\p
\v 42 He brought him to Jesus, who looked at him and said, ‘You are Simon, son of Jonah. You shall be called Kephas,’ which means Rock\f + \fr 1:42 \ft Or ‘Peter’. The Greek is Petros.\f*.
\p
\v 43 On the following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. There he found Philip and said to him, ‘Follow me.’
\v 44 Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\p
\v 45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, ‘We have found the one of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets have written: Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth.’
\p
\v 46 Nathanael asked him, ‘Can anything good come out of Nazareth?’
\p And Philip replied, ‘Come and see.’
\p
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael approaching him, and he said of him, ‘Here is an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile.’
\p
\v 48 Nathanael asked him, ‘How do you know me?’
\p Jesus replied, ‘Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.’
\p
\v 49 Nathanael’s response was to say to him, ‘Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.’
\p
\v 50 And in reply Jesus said to him, ‘Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You shall see greater things than these.’
\v 51 And he told him, ‘Truly, truly I say to you that from now on you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.’
\p

\v 1 On the third day there was a wedding at Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there.
\v 2 Jesus was also invited to the wedding with his disciples.
\v 3 Then the wine ran out, and Jesus’ mother said to him, ‘They have no wine.’
\p
\v 4 Jesus said to her, ‘What is that to me and you, woman? My time has not yet come.’
\p
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, ‘Do whatever he tells you.’
\p
\v 6 Now there were six stone water jars placed there for the ceremonial washing of the Jews, each holding two or three barrels\f + \fr 3.6 \ft ‘two or three metretas’. A metretes was approximately 9 imp. gallons (a firkin), or 40 litres – so each jar held about 100 litres.\f*.
\v 7 Jesus told them, ‘Fill the jars with water.’ And they filled them to the brim.
\v 8 Then he said to them, ‘Now draw some off and take it to the master of ceremonies.’ And they took it.
\p
\v 9 When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing its source though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of ceremonies called to the bridegroom
\v 10 and said to him, ‘Everyone serves the good wine first, and then when they have drunk freely, the less good. You have kept the good wine until now.’
\p
\v 11 This, the first of the signs, Jesus performed at Cana of Galilee revealing his glory. And his disciples believed in him.
\p
\v 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and sisters and his disciples, and they stayed for a few days.
\p
\v 13 Now the Passover of the Jews was drawing near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 In the Temple he found those selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money changers sitting there.
\v 15 He made a whip from reeds and drove them all out of the Temple, including the sheep and the oxen, and he emptied out the coins of the money-changers and overturned the tables.
\v 16 To those selling the pigeons, he said, ‘Take these things out of here. Do not turn my Father’s house into a marketplace.’
\v 17 His disciples remembered that it was written, ‘Zeal for your house will consume me.’\rq Psalms 68[69]:9\rq*
\p
\v 18 The Jews then responded by asking him, ‘By doing these things what sign are you showing us?’
\p
\v 19 And in reply Jesus told them, ‘Destroy this sanctuary and in three days I shall raise it up.’
\p
\v 20 The Jews said, ‘This sanctuary has taken forty-six years to build and you would raise it up in three days?’
\v 21 But he was speaking of the sanctuary of his body.
\v 22 And when he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and what Jesus had said.
\p
\v 23 While he was in Jerusalem for the Passover, many at the feast believed in his name when they saw his signs that he was doing.
\v 24 But Jesus did not trust himself to them because he understood them all,
\v 25 for he needed no one to vouch for anyone because he himself knew what was in each individual.
\p
\c 3
\v 1 There was a man among the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to Jesus\f +\fr 3:2\ft ‘him’ in the Greek.\f* by night and said to him, ‘Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one could perform the signs that you do if God were not with him.’
\p
\v 3 In reply Jesus told him, ‘Truly, truly I say to you that no one who has not been born anew can see the Kingdom of God.’
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus asked him, ‘How can someone who is old be born? Can one enter the mother’s womb a second time and be born?’
\p
\v 5 Jesus answered, ‘Truly, truly I say to you that no one who has not been born of water and the Spirit can enter the Kingdom of God.
\v 6 What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Do not be astonished that I have told you that you must be born anew.
\v 8 The wind blows where it wills and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.’
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus asked him, ‘How can that be?’
\p
\v 10 In reply Jesus said to him, ‘You are the teacher of Israel. Do you do not understand these things?
\v 11 Truly, truly I tell you that we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen, but you do not accept our testimony.
\v 12 If I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe, how are you to believe if I speak to you of heavenly things?
\v 13 No one has ascended into heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is of heaven.
\pi
\v 14 ‘And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up
\v 15 so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but have everlasting life.
\v 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but have everlasting life.
\v 17 For God did not send his Son into the world in order to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved through him.
\v 18 Those who believe in him are not condemned, but those who do not believe are already condemned because they have not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.
\v 19 And the judgement is this: light has come into the world, but people preferred the darkness to the light because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For all who do evil hate the light. They do not go near the light so that they may not be rebuked for what they have done.
\v 21 But those who practise the truth come to the light so that their deeds may be revealed, because they have been accomplished through God.’
\p
\v 22 After this Jesus went into the Judaean countryside with his disciples, and he remained there with them and baptised.
\v 23 John was also baptising at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water there and they came to be baptised,
\v 24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
\p
\v 25 Then a question arose between John’s disciples and a Jew concerning purification.
\v 26 They went to John and told him, ‘Rabbi, the one to whom you testified, who was with you across the Jordan, he is baptising and everyone is going to him.’
\p
\v 27 In reply John said, ‘No one can receive anything unless it has been given from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves bear witness that I said, “I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.”
\v 29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the bridegroom’s friend who stands listening to him is filled with joy by the bridegroom’s voice. And so this joy of mine is complete.
\v 30 It is necessary for him to increase and for me to decrease.’
\p
\v 31 He who comes from above is over all; he who is from the earth is of the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above everything
\v 32 and testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
\v 33 Those who do accept his testimony attest that God is Truth,
\v 34 for the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, because God gives the Spirit without constraint.
\p
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has committed everything into his hand.
\v 36 Those who believe in the Son have everlasting life. Those who do not believe in the Son will not see life, and the wrath of God rests upon them.\f +\fr 3:31-36 \ft These verses may be a continuation of the Forerunner’s reply, or they may be the Evangelist’s theological commentary, of which there are several in John’s Gospel.\f*

\v 1 When the Lord was aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptising more disciples than John –
\v 2 though it was his disciples who were baptising, not Jesus himself –
\v 3 he left Judaea and went to Galilee.
\p
\v 4 It was necessary for him to pass through Samaria,
\v 5 and so it was that he arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\v 6 Jacob’s well was there, and because he was weary from the journey Jesus sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
\p
\v 7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, ‘Give me a drink.’
\v 8 His disciples had gone away into the town to buy food.
\p
\v 9 The Samaritan woman said to him, ‘How is it that you, a Jew, are asking for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?’ For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
\p
\v 10 Jesus replied, telling her, ‘If you had known about the gift of God and who is saying to you, “Give me a drink,” you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.’
\p
\v 11 The woman said to him, ‘Sir, you have nothing with which to draw and the well is deep, so where do you keep the living water?
\v 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his children and his livestock?’
\p
\v 13 In reply Jesus told her, ‘Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
\v 14 but those who drink the water that I shall give will never be thirsty; and the water that I shall give will become in them a spring of water welling up to everlasting life.’
\p
\v 15 The woman said to him, ‘Sir, give me this water so that I may not be thirsty, nor come here to draw.’
\p
\v 16 Jesus told her, ‘Go, call your husband, and come back.’
\p
\v 17 The woman replied by saying, ‘I have no husband.’
\p Jesus told her, ‘You were honest in saying, “I have no husband,”
\v 18 for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband. In this you have spoken the truth.’
\p
\v 19 The woman said to him, ‘Sir, I see that you are a prophet.
\v 20 Your ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.’
\p
\v 21 Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, believe me. A time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
\v 22 You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.
\v 23 But a time is coming, and it is here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth, for the Father is looking for such as these to worship him.
\v 24 God is Spirit and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and Truth.’
\p
\v 25 The woman told him, ‘I know that a Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When he comes he will tell us everything.’
\p
\v 26 Jesus said to her, ‘I, who speak to you, am he.’
\p
\v 27 And with that his disciples returned. They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman, though no one said, ‘What do you want?’ or, ‘Why are you speaking with her?’
\p
\v 28 Then the woman left her water jar and went back into the town. She said to the people,
\v 29 ‘Come and see someone who has told me everything, all that I have done. Is this the Christ?’
\v 30 Leaving the town, they came to him.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, ‘Rabbi, eat.’
\p
\v 32 But he told them, ‘I have food to eat of which you are not aware.’
\p
\v 33 The disciples said to one another, ‘Could someone have brought him something to eat?’
\p
\v 34 Jesus told them, ‘My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.
\v 35 Do you not say, “Another four months and the harvest will be here?” Look, I tell you; raise your eyes and look at the fields. They are already bright for harvest,
\v 36 and the reaper is receiving his reward and gathering fruit for everlasting life so that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
\v 37 For here the saying is true: one sows and another reaps.
\v 38 I have sent you out to reap that for which you have not laboured. Others have laboured and you have come to benefit from their labour.’
\p
\v 39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of what the woman had said in testifying, ‘He told me everything that I have done.’
\v 40 And so when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there for two days.
\v 41 Then many more believed because of his words,
\v 42 and they told the woman, ‘It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard and we know that this is truly the Saviour of the world, the Christ.’
\p
\v 43 After those two days, he set out from there and went to Galilee.
\v 44 Now Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country,
\v 45 but when he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had witnessed all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.
\v 46 So it was that Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee where he had made the water wine.
\p At Capernaum there was a nobleman whose son was ill,
\v 47 and when he heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.
\v 48 But Jesus told him, ‘Unless you see signs and wonders you will never believe.’
\p
\v 49 The nobleman said to him, ‘Lord, come down before my child dies.’
\p
\v 50 Jesus replied, ‘Go on your way. Your son lives.’ And the man believed what Jesus had said to him, and left.
\v 51 While he was still on the way down his servants met him and brought news, saying, ‘Your child lives.’
\v 52 He asked them the time at which he began to improve, and they told him, ‘Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.’
\v 53 The father knew that it was then that Jesus had told him, ‘Your son lives.’ And he believed, he and his whole household.
\p
\v 54 This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judaea to Galilee.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 In Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate there is a pool. It is called Bethesda in Hebrew, and it has five colonnades.
\v 3 Under these a great number of the sick were lying: the blind, the lame, the withered. They were waiting for the movement of the water,
\v 4 for from time to time an angel would descend into the pool and the water would be stirred up. Then the first to get in after the movement of the water would be made well from whatever disease had taken hold.
\p
\v 5 There was one man who had been ill for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 Jesus saw this man stretched out and knew that he had already been there for a long time. He asked him, ‘Do you want to be made well?’
\v 7 The sick man replied, ‘Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am on my way someone else gets in before me.’
\v 8 Jesus said to him, ‘Rise, pick up your mattress and walk.’
\v 9 And immediately the man was made well; he picked up his mattress and walked.
\p Now that day was the Sabbath,
\v 10 and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, ‘It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mattress.’
\p
\v 11 He answered them, ‘The one who made me well, it was he who told me, “Pick up your mattress and walk.”’
\p
\v 12 They then asked him, ‘Who is this man who told you to pick up your mattress and walk?’
\v 13 But the man who had been healed did not know who he was, for Jesus had quietly slipped away, and the place was crowded.
\p
\v 14 Later Jesus found him in the Temple and said to him, ‘Now that you are well, sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you.’
\v 15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
\v 16 This was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus and wanted to kill him, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
\p
\v 17 Jesus told them, ‘My Father is working even now; I too am working.’
\v 18 Then because of this the Jews sought all the more to kill him, not only because he was breaking the Sabbath, but also because he was saying that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.
\p
\v 19 Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly I tell you that the Son can do nothing of himself unless it is something he sees the Father doing, because whatever he does, the Son does likewise.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing, and greater works than these he will show him and you will marvel.
\v 21 Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he wishes.
\v 22 And the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgement to the Son
\v 23 so that all may honour the Son as they honour the Father. Whoever does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him.
\pi
\v 24 ‘Truly, truly I tell you that all who listen to my word and believe in him who sent me have everlasting life and do not come to judgement, for they have passed from death to life.
\v 25 Truly, truly I tell you that the hour is coming, and it is here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
\v 26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted to the Son to have life in himself as well.
\v 27 He has also given him authority to execute judgement because he is the Son of Man.
\v 28 Do not be astonished by this, for a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
\v 29 and come out: those who have done what is good to a resurrection of life, and those who have done what is evil to a resurrection of condemnation.
\pi
\v 30 ‘I can do nothing of myself. As I hear I judge, and my judgement is just because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.
\v 31 If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid;
\v 32 there is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony with which he bears witness to me is valid.
\pi
\v 33 ‘You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.
\v 34 But I accept testimony from no human being. Nevertheless I am saying these things so that you may be saved.
\v 35 That man was the lamp, alight and shining, and for a while you were happy to rejoice in his light.
\v 36 But the testimony I have is greater than John’s, for the labours the Father has entrusted to me to accomplish, the very works I perform, testify of me that the Father has sent me.
\pi
\v 37 ‘The Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You have never at any time heard his voice or seen what he looks like,
\v 38 nor do you have his word living in you because you do not believe him whom he has sent.
\v 39 You search the Scriptures because you expect to gain from them everlasting life, and it is they that bear witness to me;
\v 40 yet you will not come to me so that you may have life.
\pi
\v 41 ‘I accept no honour from human beings,
\v 42 for I know that you do not have the love of God within you.
\v 43 I have come in my Father’s name, but you do not accept me. If someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.
\v 44 How can you believe when you accept honour from one another but do not want the honour that comes from God alone?
\pi
\v 45 ‘Do not imagine that I shall accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you trust.
\v 46 But if you did believe Moses, you would believe me because he wrote about me.
\v 47 If you do not believe his written word, how will you believe my spoken words?’
\p
\c 6
\v 1 After this Jesus went away to the far side of the Sea of Galilee, or Tiberias,
\v 2 and a large crowd followed him because they saw his signs that he performed on those who were ill.
\v 3 Jesus then went up the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.
\v 4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
\v 5 Jesus raised his eyes and saw the large crowd coming towards him. He asked Philip, ‘Where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat?’
\v 6 But he said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was about to do.
\p
\v 7 Philip gave him this reply, ‘Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to receive a little.’
\p
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,
\v 9 ‘There is one boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they among so many?’
\p
\v 10 But Jesus said, ‘Make the people sit down.’ Now there was a lot of grass in the place, and so the men sat down. They numbered about five thousand.
\v 11 Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks. He passed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were seated; and in the same way the fish, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 When they were fully satisfied, he told his disciples, ‘Collect the fragments that are left over so that nothing may be lost.’
\v 13 They gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
\p
\v 14 When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they said, ‘This is truly the Prophet who is coming into the world.’
\v 15 Then Jesus, realising that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, once more withdrew to the mountain alone.
\p
\v 16 In the evening his disciples went down to the sea,
\v 17 got into the boat, and set off across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark. Jesus had not returned to them,
\v 18 and the sea was getting up because a strong wind was blowing.
\v 19 When they had rowed on for three or four miles\f + \fr 6.19 \ft ‘twenty-five or thirty stadia’. A stadion was one eighth of a mile.\f*, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, coming towards the boat, and they were terrified.
\v 20 But Jesus said to them, ‘It is I. Do not be afraid.’
\v 21 They gladly received him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore for which they were making.
\p
\v 22 On the following day the crowd that was on the other side of the sea had seen that there had been no boat there, other than the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples, but his disciples had gone off alone.
\v 23 However, other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread blessed by the Lord,
\v 24 and so when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they too got into the boats and returned to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.
\v 25 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, ‘Rabbi, when did you get here?’
\p
\v 26 In reply Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly I tell you that you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were well fed.
\v 27 Do not labour for food that perishes, but for the food that endures for life everlasting that the Son of Man will give to you. For it is he upon whom God the Father has set his seal.’
\p
\v 28 Then they asked him, ‘What should we do to be doing the works of God?’
\p
\v 29 And Jesus repied, telling them, ‘This is the work of God: that you believe in him whom he has sent.’
\p
\v 30 They said to him, ‘What sign will you give us so that we may see and believe in you? What is the work are you doing?
\v 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, “He gave them bread from heaven to eat.”\rq Psalms 77[78]:24-25\rq*’
\p
\v 32 But Jesus told them, ‘Truly, truly I tell you that Moses did not give you the bread from heaven. No, my Father gives you the true bread from heaven,
\v 33 for the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.’
\p
\v 34 They said to him, ‘Lord, give us this bread all the time.’
\p
\v 35 Jesus told them, ‘I AM the Bread of Life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
\v 36 And as I have told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.
\v 37 All whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and those who come to me I shall never turn away.
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my will, but the will of him who sent me;
\v 39 and this is the will of the Father who sent me: that I should lose nothing of all he has given to me, but raise it up on the last day.
\v 40 This is the will of the one who sent me, that all who look upon the Son and believe in him may have everlasting life, and I shall raise them up on the last day.’
\p
\v 41 The Jews were muttering about him because he said, ‘I AM the Bread that came down from heaven.’
\v 42 They were saying, ‘Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? How then can this man say, “I have come down from heaven?”’
\p
\v 43 Jesus responded by telling them, ‘Do not mutter among yourselves.
\v 44 Only those who are drawn by the Father who sent me can come to me, and I shall raise them up on the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, “And they will all be taught by God.”\rq Isaiah 54:13\rq* Everyone who listens to the Father and learns, comes to me.
\v 46 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the one who is from God: he has seen the Father.
\v 47 Truly, truly I tell you, whoever believes in me has everlasting life.
\pi
\v 48 ‘I AM the Bread of Life.
\v 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
\v 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat it and not die.
\v 51 I AM the Living Bread that has come down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live for ever, and the bread that I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.’
\p
\v 52 The Jews were arguing among themselves, saying, ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’
\p
\v 53 But Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly I tell you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and do not drink his blood, you do not have life in you.
\v 54 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have everlasting life, and I shall raise them up on the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
\v 56 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood remain in me and I in them.
\v 57 Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will also live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread that has come down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate the manna and died, those who eat this bread will live for ever.’
\p
\v 59 He said these things in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum,
\v 60 and many of his disciples on hearing it said, ‘This is a difficult message. Who can listen to him?’
\p
\v 61 But Jesus was aware that his disciples were grumbling about this and he asked them, ‘Does this offend you?
\v 62 Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
\v 63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no benefit. The words I speak to you, they are Spirit and they are Life.
\v 64 But there are some of you who do not believe.’ For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe and who it was that would betray him,
\v 65 and he said, ‘This is why I have told you that no one can come to me unless my Father has granted it.’
\p
\v 66 After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
\v 67 Jesus then asked the Twelve, ‘Do you want to leave too?’
\p
\v 68 Simon Peter replied, ‘Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of everlasting life,
\v 69 and we believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’
\p
\v 70 Jesus told them, ‘Did I not choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.’
\v 71 He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, intended to betray him.
\p
\c 7
\v 1 After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he did not want to walk around in Judaea because the Jews were seeking to kill him.
\v 2 But Tabernacles, a feast of the Jews, was drawing near,
\v 3 and his brothers said to him, ‘Get away from here and go to Judaea so that your disciples may see the deeds that you do.
\v 4 People do not work in secret when they want to be well known. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.’
\v 5 For not even his brothers believed in him.
\p
\v 6 Jesus told them, ‘My time has not yet come, but your time is always to hand.
\v 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil.
\v 8 As for you, go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast yet because my time has not fully come.’
\p
\v 9 After he had told them this, he stayed in Galilee.
\v 10 But when his brothers had gone up, then he too went up to the feast, not openly, but as if in secret.
\p
\v 11 Now the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and they were asking, ‘Where is that man?’
\v 12 And there was much whispering among the crowds about him. Some were saying, ‘He is a good man.’ Others were saying, ‘No, he is deceiving the people.’
\v 13 But no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews.
\p
\v 14 It was now the middle of the feast. Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach,
\v 15 and the Jews were amazed, saying, ‘How does this man have such knowledge, not being educated?’
\v 16 In reply Jesus told them, ‘My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
\v 17 Anyone who wants to do his will will know whether the teaching is from God, or whether I am speaking for myself.
\v 18 Those who speak for themselves seek their own glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
\v 19 Has Moses not given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you want to kill me?’
\p
\v 20 The crowd responded by saying, ‘You have a demon. Who wants to kill you?’
\p
\v 21 And in reply Jesus told them, ‘I did one work and you all marvel.
\v 22 This is why Moses gave you circumcision, not that it is from Moses but from the ancestors, and on the Sabbath you circumcise.
\v 23 If someone receives circumcision on the Sabbath without breaking the law of Moses, why are you angry with me because I have made someone completely whole on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge by outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgement.’
\p
\v 25 Then some from Jerusalem said, ‘Is this not the one they want to kill?
\v 26 But look, he is speaking openly and they are not saying anything to him. Perhaps all the rulers really know that this is truly the Christ.
\v 27 And yet we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one knows where he will come from.’
\p
\v 28 Then Jesus called out as he was teaching in the Temple, saying, ‘You both know me and know where I am from, but I have not come at my own bidding\f +\fr 7:28\ft ‘bidding’ is not in the Greek.\f*. The one who sent me is true, but you do not know him.
\v 29 I know him because I come from him and he has sent me.’
\v 30 They wanted to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come.
\p
\v 31 Many in the crowd believed in him and said, ‘Will the Christ, when he comes, perform more signs than this man has done?’
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about him, and the Pharisees with the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.
\p
\v 33 Jesus said, ‘For a little while longer I shall be with you, then I am going to him who sent me.
\v 34 You will look for me but you will not find me, for where I am you cannot come.’
\p
\v 35 The Jews then said among themselves, ‘Where is this man intending to go so that we shall not find him? He is not about to go to the Greek Diaspora and teach the Greeks, is he?
\v 36 Why did he say, “You will look for me but you will not find me, for where I am you cannot come”?’
\p
\v 37 On the last and most important day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried out, saying, ‘If anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink.
\v 38 From within the one who believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water shall flow.’
\v 39 Now he said this about the Spirit whom those who believed in him were about to receive, for the Holy Spirit had not yet come because Jesus was yet to be glorified.
\p
\v 40 On hearing these words, many in the crowd said, ‘This is truly the prophet.’
\v 41 Some were saying, ‘This is the Christ.’ Others were saying, ‘But the Christ does not come from Galilee.
\v 42 No, Scripture says that the Christ comes from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was.’\rq 2 Kingdoms[1 Sam] 7:12; Micah 5:2\rq*
\v 43 And so the crowd was in two minds about him.
\v 44 Some wanted to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him.
\p
\v 45 When the officers returned, the chief priests and Pharisees asked them, ‘Why have you not brought him?’
\v 46 The officers replied, ‘No one ever spoke like this man.’
\v 47 And the Pharisees responded, ‘Surely you have not been deceived?
\v 48 Have any of the rulers believed in him? Or the Pharisees?
\v 49 Just this accursed rabble who do not know the law.’
\p
\v 50 Nicodemus, the one who came to him by night, was one of the Pharisees, and he said to them,
\v 51 ‘Does our law condemn a man without first listening to him and finding out what he has done?’
\v 52 In reply they said to him, ‘Surely you are not from Galilee as well? Search and you will see that no prophet has arisen from Galilee.’\rq Cf. Isaiah 9:1\rq*
\p
\v 53 Then they left, each to his home.
\p
\c 8
\v 1 And Jesus made his way to the Mount of Olives.
\p
\v 2 Then at dawn he appeared once more in the Temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
\p
\v 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught committing adultery, and standing her at the centre
\v 4 they told him, ‘Teacher, this woman was apprehended in the very act of committing adultery.
\v 5 Now in our law Moses commanded that such a person is to be stoned.\rq Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22\rq* But what do you say?’
\p
\v 6 They said this to test him, in order to have an accusation against him, but Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.
\v 7 When they continued to question him, he lifted his head and told them, ‘Let one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’
\v 8 And once more, bending down, he wrote on the ground.
\v 9 On hearing this, they left, one by one, beginning with the older ones.
\p Jesus was left with the woman at the centre.
\v 10 Lifting his head, Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’
\p
\v 11 She said, ‘No one, Lord.’
\p Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go on your way, and from now on sin no more.’
\p
\v 12 Once again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I AM the Light of the World. Anyone who follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.’
\p
\v 13 Then the Pharisees said to him, ‘You are bearing witness to yourself; your testimony is not valid.’
\p
\v 14 Jesus responded, telling them, ‘Even if I am bearing witness to myself, my testimony is valid because I know where I came from and where I am going. As for you, you do not know where I came from or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge according to the flesh. I am not judging anyone.
\v 16 But if I do judge, my judgement is valid because it is not only I, but both I and the Father who sent me,
\v 17 and in your law it is written that the testimony of two people is valid.\rq Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15\rq*
\v 18 I am one of those bearing witness to me; the Father who sent me also bears witness to me.’
\p
\v 19 Then they asked him, ‘Where is your father?’
\p Jesus replied, ‘You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would also know my Father.’
\p
\v 20 Jesus said these things in the treasury while he was teaching in the Temple, but no one arrested him because his time had not yet come.
\p
\v 21 Once more Jesus spoke to them. ‘I am going away and you will look for me, but you will die in your sins. Where I am going you cannot come.’
\p
\v 22 The Jews were saying, ‘Is he going to kill himself, because he says, “Where I am going you cannot come”?’
\p
\v 23 He told them, ‘You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
\v 24 That is why I told you that you will die in your sins, for if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.’
\p
\v 25 They then asked him, ‘Who are you?’
\p And Jesus told them, ‘Just what I have been saying to you from the start.
\v 26 I have much to say about you, and to condemn, for he who sent me is truthful, and what I hear from him I announce to the world.’
\p
\v 27 They did not understand that he was speaking to them of the Father,
\v 28 and so Jesus said to them, ‘When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM. For I do nothing of myself, but what I proclaim is what my Father has taught me.
\v 29 And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me on my own, because I always do what is pleasing to him.’
\p
\v 30 As he spoke of these things, many believed in him.
\p
\v 31 Jesus said to the Jews who believed him, ‘If you stay with my word, you are truly my disciples
\v 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.’
\p
\v 33 They told him, ‘We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone. What do you mean by saying, “You will be free?”’
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, ‘Truly, truly I tell you that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
\v 35 A slave does not remain in the house for ever; the son does remain for ever.
\v 36 Therefore if the Son makes you free, you will be truly free.
\v 37 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants, yet you want to kill me because my word has no place in you.
\v 38 I speak of what I have seen in my Father, and in the same way you practise what you have seen in your father.’
\p
\v 39 Their response was to say to him, ‘Abraham is our father.’
\p Jesus told them, ‘If you were Abraham’s children, you would be doing what Abraham did.
\v 40 And now you want to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I have heard from God. Abraham did not act like that.
\v 41 You do what your father does.’
\p And they said to him, ‘We were not born of fornication. We have one Father, God.’
\p
\v 42 Then Jesus told them, ‘If God were your Father, you would love me because I came from God, and here I am. I have not come at my own bidding\f +\fr 8:42\ft ‘bidding’ is not in the Greek.\f*, but he has sent me.
\v 43 Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are incapable of hearing my word.
\v 44 You come from your father the devil, and you long to practise your father’s evil desires. He was a murderer from the start, and he does not stand by the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie he is speaking in his own way, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
\v 45 And so, because I am speaking the truth, you do not believe me.
\pi
\v 46 ‘Who among you convicts me of sin? Why then, if I speak the truth, do you not believe me?
\v 47 The one who is of God listens to what God is saying. This is why you do not listen: because you are not of God.’
\p
\v 48 Then in reply the Jews said to him, ‘Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?’
\v 49 Jesus replied, ‘I do not have a demon, but I am honouring my Father; and you are dishonouring me.
\v 50 Though I am not seeking my own glory, there is one who does; and it is he who judges.
\v 51 Truly, truly I tell you that whoever keeps my word will never see death.’
\p
\v 52 The Jews then said to him, ‘Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets, and yet you say, “Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.”
\v 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham who died, and the prophets who died? Who are you making yourself out to be?’
\p
\v 54 Jesus replied, ‘If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father, of whom you say that he is your God.
\v 55 You do not know him, but I know him. If I said that I did not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and I keep his word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he might see my day. He saw it and was glad.’
\p
\v 57 The Jews said to him, ‘You are not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham!’
\p
\v 58 Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly I tell you, before the coming of Abraham, I AM.’
\p
\v 59 And they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus concealed himself and left the Temple. Going through the middle of them, he went on his way.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 As he was passing by he saw a man blind from birth,
\v 2 and his disciples asked him, ‘Rabbi, who has sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’
\p
\v 3 Jesus replied, ‘It is not that he or his parents sinned, but so that the work of God may be revealed in him.
\v 4 I must perform the work of the one who sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work.
\v 5 While I am in the world, I AM the Light of the World.’
\v 6 Saying this, he spat on the ground, made mud from the saliva, and smeared the mud on the blind man’s eyes.
\v 7 Then he told him, ‘Go and wash in the pool of Siloam,’ which means sent. He went and washed and came back seeing.
\p
\v 8 Then the neighbours and those who had previously seen that he was blind said, ‘Is this not the man who sits and begs?’
\v 9 Some were saying, ‘It is,’ and others, ‘He looks like him.’
\p The man himself said, ‘I am he.’
\p
\v 10 Then they asked him, ‘How were your eyes opened?’
\p
\v 11 He replied, ‘A man called Jesus made mud and smeared my eyes, and he told me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’ When I went and washed I recovered my sight.’
\p
\v 12 They asked him, ‘Where is this man?’
\p He said, ‘I do not know.’
\p
\v 13 They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.
\v 14 Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes,
\v 15 and the Pharisees questioned him again about how he recovered his sight. He told them, ‘He put mud on my eyes, then I washed and I saw.’
\p
\v 16 Some of the Pharisees were saying, ‘This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.’ Others were saying, ‘How can a sinful man perform such signs?’ And there was division among them.
\v 17 They spoke to the blind man once again. ‘What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.’
\p He said, ‘He is a prophet.’
\p
\v 18 But the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had recovered his sight until they had spoken to the parents of the man who had recovered his sight.
\v 19 They asked them, ‘Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How is it that he now sees?’
\p
\v 20 His parents replied, ‘We know that this is our son and that he was born blind,
\v 21 but how he now sees we do not know; nor do we know who opened his eyes. He is of age, ask him. He will speak for himself.’
\v 22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged him as Christ would be expelled from the synagogue.
\v 23 This was why his parents said, ‘He is of age, ask him.’
\p
\v 24 Then, for a second time, they called the man who had been blind and told him, ‘Give God the glory. We know that this man is a sinner.’
\p
\v 25 But the man said, ‘Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know: I was blind and now I see.’
\p
\v 26 Again they asked him, ‘What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?’
\p
\v 27 He answered them, ‘I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples as well?’
\p
\v 28 They reviled him, saying, ‘You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but this man! We do not know where he comes from.’
\p
\v 30 The man’s response was to say to them, ‘Why, this is a wonder. You do not know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
\v 31 Now we know that God does not listen to sinners. But if someone fears God and does his will, then God listens.
\v 32 Through the ages there is no report of anyone having opened the eyes of someone born blind.
\v 33 If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything.’
\p
\v 34 Their response was to tell him, ‘You were born in utter sin, yet you would teach us!’ And they expelled him.
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had expelled him, and when he found him he asked him, ‘Do you believe in the Son of God?’
\p
\v 36 The man replied, ‘And who is he, sir, so that I may believe in him?’
\p
\v 37 Jesus told him, ‘You have already seen him, for the one speaking to you is he.’
\p
\v 38 Then he declared, ‘Lord, I believe.’ And he worshipped him.
\p
\v 39 Jesus said, ‘I have come into this world for judgement so that those who do not see may see, and so that those who do see may become blind.’
\p
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees with him heard this and asked him, ‘Surely we are not blind as well?’
\p
\v 41 Jesus told them, ‘If you were blind you would have no sin, but now because you say, “We see” your sin remains.
\pi
\c 10
\v 1 ‘Truly, truly I tell you that anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in another way is a thief and a robber.
\v 2 The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 The gatekeeper opens up, the sheep hear the voice, and the shepherd’s\f +\fr 1:3-4\ft ‘shepherd’ is not in the Greek of either of these verses.\f* own sheep are called by name and led out.
\v 4 And when the sheep are brought out, the shepherd walks in front of them and the sheep follow because they know the shepherd’s voice.
\v 5 They will never follow a stranger, but they will run away because they do not recognise the stranger’s voice.’
\p
\v 6 Jesus told them this parable but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
\p
\v 7 Again Jesus spoke to them. ‘Truly, truly I tell you, I am the Gate for the sheep.
\v 8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
\v 9 I AM the Gate. Anyone who enters through me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.
\v 10 The thief comes only to steal, to kill and to destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it in abundance.
\pi
\v 11 ‘I AM the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep,
\v 12 but the hired hand, not being a shepherd and not owning the sheep, on seeing a wolf coming, abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf carries the sheep off and scatters them.
\v 13 The hired hand, being a hired hand, runs away and does not care about the sheep.
\v 14 I AM the Good Shepherd. I know my own and I am known by those who are mine,
\v 15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 I have other sheep, not of this fold; I must fetch them too. They will listen to my voice and there will be one flock, one Shepherd.
\v 17 This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take up it again.
\v 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have the power to lay it down, and I have the power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.’
\p
\v 19 Once again there was a division of opinion among the Jews because of these words.
\v 20 Many of them said, ‘He has a demon and is raving. Why do you listen to him?’
\v 21 Others said, ‘These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?’
\p
\v 22 The Dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter.
\v 23 Jesus was walking in the Temple, in Solomon’s colonnade,
\v 24 and the Jews gathered around him. They asked him, ‘How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.’
\p
\v 25 Jesus answered them, ‘I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness to me.
\v 26 But you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. As I have told you,
\v 27 the sheep who are mine listen to my voice. I know them and they follow me,
\v 28 and I give them everlasting life so that they will never perish. And no one will snatch them from my hand.
\v 29 My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand.
\v 30 I and the Father are one.’
\p
\v 31 Then once again the Jews picked up stones to stone him.
\v 32 Jesus said to them, ‘I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of these works are you stoning me?’
\p
\v 33 The Jews replied, saying to him, ‘We are not stoning you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a human being, are making yourself out to be God.’
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, ‘Is it not written in your law, “I said you are gods”\rq Psalms 81[82]:6\rq*?
\v 35 Although he called them gods, those to whom the word of God came – and Scripture cannot be set aside –
\v 36 you are saying of the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, “You are blaspheming” because I said, “I am the Son of God.”
\v 37 If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
\v 38 But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works so that you may recognise and believe that the Father is in me and I in him.’
\p
\v 39 Then yet again they wanted to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.
\p
\v 40 He returned once again to the far side of the Jordan, to the place where John first baptised, and he remained there.
\v 41 Many came to him, and they were saying, ‘Although John performed no sign, every single thing John said about this man is true.’
\v 42 And many believed in him there.
\p
\c 11
\v 1 Someone was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
\v 2 It was Mary who had anointed the Lord with oil and wiped his feet with her hair, and it was her brother Lazarus who was ill.
\v 3 And so the sisters sent word\f +\fr 11:3\ft ‘word’ is not in the Greek.\f* to him saying, ‘Lord, he whom you love is ill.’
\v 4 But when Jesus heard, he said, ‘This illness is not to death but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.’
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus,
\v 6 but even so, when he heard that he was ill he stayed where he was for two days.
\v 7 After that he said to the disciples, ‘Let us go to Judaea again.’
\p
\v 8 The disciples said to him, ‘Rabbi, only recently the Jews were trying to stone you. Are you going there again?’
\p
\v 9 Jesus replied, ‘Are there not twelve hours of daytime? If people walk in the daytime they do not stumble, because they see the light of this world;
\v 10 but if they walk at night they stumble because they do not have the light.’
\v 11 He said this and then told them, ‘Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him.’
\p
\v 12 The disciples replied, ‘Lord, if he has fallen asleep he will be saved.’
\p
\v 13 Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 And so Jesus then told them plainly, ‘Lazarus is dead.
\v 15 I am glad for your sake that I was not there so that you may believe. But let us go to him.’
\p
\v 16 Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to the other disciples, ‘Yes, let us go so that we may die with him.’
\p
\v 17 When Jesus arrived he found that Lazarus\f +\fr 11:17\ft ‘he’ in the Greek.\f* had already been in the tomb for four days.
\v 18 Bethany is near Jerusalem, about two miles\f +\fr 11:18 \ft ‘fifteen stadia’. A stadion is one eighth of a mile.\f* away,
\v 19 and many Jews had joined those nearby to comfort Martha and Mary about their brother.
\v 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was arriving she went to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
\v 21 Martha said to Jesus, ‘Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died,
\v 22 but even now I know that whatever you ask God, God will give you.’
\v 23 Jesus told her, ‘Your brother will rise again.’
\p
\v 24 Martha said to him, ‘I know that he will rise again at the resurrection on the Last Day.’
\p
\v 25 Jesus said to her, ‘I AM the Resurrection and the Life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live.
\v 26 And all who live and believe in me will never die. Do you believe this?’
\p
\v 27 She told him, ‘Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who is coming into the world.’
\p
\v 28 She said this, and then went to call her sister Mary. She said to her privately, ‘The Teacher is here and is calling you.’
\v 29 On hearing this, she set off quickly and went to him,
\v 30 for Jesus had not yet reached the village but was at the place where Martha had met him.
\v 31 The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out, and they followed her, saying, ‘She is going to the tomb to weep there.’
\v 32 When Mary came to where Jesus was, she saw him, fell at his feet, and said to him, ‘Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.’
\p
\v 33 And Jesus, seeing her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, groaned in spirit and was deeply moved.
\v 34 He asked, ‘Where have you laid him?’
\p They said to him, ‘Lord, come and see.’
\p
\v 35 Jesus wept,
\v 36 and the Jews said, ‘See how he loved him.’
\v 37 But some of them said, ‘Was he who opened the eyes of the blind man not able to act so that this man might not have died?’
\p
\v 38 Jesus, again groaning within himself, went to the tomb. It was a cave and a stone was placed against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, ‘Take away the stone.’
\p Martha, the dead man’s sister, told him, ‘Lord, he smells already, for it has been four days.’
\p
\v 40 Jesus said to her, ‘Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?’
\p
\v 41 And so they took the stone away from where the dead man had been laid, and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, ‘Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
\v 42 I know that you always listen to me, but I am saying it because of the crowd standing around, so that they may believe that you sent me.’
\v 43 After saying this he cried out in a loud voice, ‘Lazarus, come out.’
\v 44 And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with winding-sheets and with a cloth wrapped around his face.
\p Jesus said to them, ‘Untie him and let him go.’
\p
\v 45 Then when many of the Jews who had come to Mary saw what Jesus had done, they believed in him.
\v 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
\v 47 The chief priests and the Pharisees convened a Sanhedrin and said, ‘What are we to do? For this man is performing many signs.
\v 48 If we leave him be like this, everyone will believe in him and then the Romans will come and remove both our Holy\f +\fr 11:48\ft ‘Holy’ is not in the Greek.\f* Place and our nation.’
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas who was High Priest that year, said to them, ‘You know nothing.
\v 50 Do you not think that it is better for us that one man should die on behalf of the people than for the whole nation to perish?’
\v 51 He did not say this of himself, but being High Priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,
\v 52 and not only for the nation but also to bring the scattered children of God together as one.
\v 53 And from that day they conspired to kill him.
\p
\v 54 Then Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but left that place for a region close to the desert, for a town called Ephraim, and he remained there with his disciples.
\p
\v 55 The Passover of the Jews was near, and before Passover many went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves.
\v 56 They were standing in the Temple looking for Jesus, saying to one another, ‘What do you think? Will he come to the feast or not?’
\v 57 The chief priests together with the Pharisees had issued an order that anyone who knew where he was must report it, so that they might arrest him.
\p
\c 12
\v 1 Six days before the Passover Jesus arrived at Bethany where Lazarus was, he who had died and whom he had raised from the dead,
\v 2 and they provided supper for him there. Martha was serving and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.
\p
\v 3 Mary took a pound of very expensive perfumed oil of pure spikenard. She anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
\v 4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son who was going to betray him, said,
\v 5 ‘Why was this oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?’
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief; he had the money bag and was taking out what was put in.
\p
\v 7 Jesus said, ‘Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
\v 8 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.’
\p
\v 9 Now a great number of the Jews knew that he was there and they came, not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 The chief priests had resolved to kill Lazarus as well,
\v 11 for on his account many of the Jews were drawn away and believed in Jesus.
\p
\v 12 On the following day a great crowd of those who had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was arriving in Jerusalem,
\v 13 took palm branches and went out to meet him. They were shouting, ‘Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.’\rq Psalms 117[118]:25-26\rq*
\p
\v 14 Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it. As it is written,
\v 15 ‘Do not be afraid, daughter of Sion. You see your King coming, sitting on a foal of a donkey.’\rq Zechariah 9:9\rq*
\v 16 His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified they then remembered that this had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
\p
\v 17 The crowds with him were witnessing that he had called Lazarus from the tomb and had raised him from the dead,
\v 18 Indeed, it was because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowds had come to meet him.
\v 19 The Pharisees then said to one another, ‘You see that there is nothing to be gained. Just look! The world has gone after him.’
\p
\v 20 Now among those coming up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.
\v 21 They approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they said to him, ‘Sir, we want to see Jesus.’
\v 22 Philip went and told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
\v 23 Jesus responded by saying to them, ‘The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly I tell you that unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies it will bear much fruit.
\v 25 Those who love their life will lose it; those who hate their life in this world will keep it for ever.
\v 26 If any want to serve me, let them follow me, for where I am, there my servant will be also. If any want to serve me, the Father will honour them.
\pi
\v 27 ‘Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? “Father, save me from this hour”? But this is why I have come to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify your name.’
\p Then a voice came from heaven saying, ‘I have glorified it and shall glorify it again.’
\p
\v 29 On hearing it, the crowd standing there said that it was thunder. Others were saying, ‘An angel has spoken to him.’
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus spoke. He said, ‘This voice has come not for my sake but for yours.
\v 31 Now is the judgement of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be driven out.
\v 32 And when I am lifted up from the earth I shall draw everyone to myself.’
\v 33 He said this to signify the kind of death he would die.
\p
\v 34 The crowd said to him, ‘We understand from the law that the Christ remains for ever\rq Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 2:44; but cf. Isaiah 53:8\rq*, so why are you saying that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?’
\p
\v 35 Jesus told them, ‘For a little longer the light will be with you. Walk while you have the light so that the darkness may not overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness do not know where they are going.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become children of light.’ After he had said this, Jesus departed and was hidden from them.
\p
\v 37 Although he performed many signs in their presence they did not believe in him.
\v 38 This was to fulfil the words of Isaiah the prophet, who said, ‘Lord, who has believed our news, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?’\rq Isaiah 53:1\rq*
\v 39 They could not believe because Isaiah also said this,
\v 40 ‘He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts so that they may not see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts, nor turn back for me to heal them.’\rq Isaiah 6:10\rq*
\v 41 Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke about him.
\v 42 Even so, many of the rulers did believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not admit it so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue,
\v 43 for they loved the respect of the people more than being honoured by God.
\p
\v 44 Jesus cried out, saying, ‘Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me;
\v 45 and whoever sees me, sees him who sent me.
\v 46 I have come as a light to the world so that everyone who believes in me may not remain in darkness.
\v 47 I do not judge anyone who listens to my words and does not believe, for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.
\v 48 Those who reject me and do not accept my words have a judge. On the Last Day what I have said shall judge them.
\v 49 For what I have said does not come from me, but the Father who sent me has commanded me about what I should say and what I should preach.
\v 50 And I know that what he commands is everlasting life. Therefore I speak as the Father has told me; that is how I speak.’
\p
\c 13
\v 1 Before the Feast of Passover Jesus knew that the time had come for him to go from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.
\p
\v 2 When supper came, the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him.
\v 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given everything into his hands and that he had come from God and was going to God,
\v 4 rose from supper, laid aside his clothes, took a towel and wrapped it around him.
\v 5 Then he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel in which he was wrapped.
\v 6 When he came to Simon Peter, that disciple said to him, ‘You, Lord, wash my feet?’
\p
\v 7 Jesus answered him by saying, ‘You do not realise now what I am doing, but you will understand later.’
\p
\v 8 Peter told him, ‘You shall not wash my feet, not ever!’
\p Jesus replied, ‘If I do not wash you, you do not belong to me.’
\p
\v 9 Simon Peter said to him, ‘Lord, not only my feet, but my hands too, and my head.’
\p
\v 10 Jesus told him, ‘Those who have bathed need only wash their feet, for they are completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.’
\v 11 He knew the one who was betraying him, and that is why he said, ‘You are not all clean.’
\p
\v 12 When he had washed their feet and taken his clothes, he sat down again and asked them, ‘Do you understand what I have done for you?
\v 13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you do right, for so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you too should wash one another’s feet.
\v 15 I have given you an example so that what I have done for you, you may do as well.
\v 16 Truly, truly I tell you that a servant is not greater than the master, nor is an apostle greater than the one who sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
\v 18 I am not speaking about all of you. I know those whom I have chosen for myself, but let the Scripture be fulfilled: “The one who eats bread with me has raised his heel against me.”\rq Psalms 40[41]:9\rq*
\v 19 From now on I shall tell you before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I AM.
\v 20 Truly, truly I tell you that whoever receives the one whom I send is receiving me, and whoever receives me is receiving him who sent me.’
\p
\v 21 After saying these things Jesus was troubled in spirit, and he testified, saying, ‘Truly, truly I tell you that one of you will betray me.’
\p
\v 22 The disciples looked at one another, wondering about whom he was speaking.
\v 23 There was one of his disciples, one whom Jesus loved, reclining close to Jesus.
\v 24 Simon Peter signalled to this man to enquire of whom he was speaking,
\v 25 and he, leaning back on Jesus’ breast, asked him, ‘Lord, who is it?’
\p
\v 26 Jesus replied, ‘When I have dipped this piece of bread it is the one to whom I give it,’ and when he had dipped the bread he gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.
\v 27 And after the bread, Satan entered that man. Then Jesus told him, ‘What you are to do, do quickly.’
\p
\v 28 None at those at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him,
\v 29 but some supposed that because Judas had the money bag Jesus was telling him, ‘Buy what we need for the feast,’ or that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 Immediately after receiving the bread that man went out, and it was night.
\p
\v 31 When he had left, Jesus said, ‘Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\v 32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him soon.
\v 33 Children, I shall be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, but as I told the Jews and am now telling you, where I am going you cannot come.
\v 34 I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. As I have loved you, so you are to love one another.
\v 35 It is through this, your love for one another, that everyone will know that you are my disciples.’
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter asked him, ‘Lord, where are you going?’
\p Jesus answered him, ‘Where I am going you cannot now follow, but you will follow me later.’
\p
\v 37 Peter said to him, ‘Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.’
\p
\v 38 Jesus answered him, ‘Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I tell you that the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times.
\pi
\c 14
\v 1 ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, and believe in me.
\v 2 In my Father’s house there are many resting-places, otherwise I should have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you,
\v 3 and when I have gone and prepared a place for you I shall come again and take you to myself, so that where I am you may be too.
\v 4 You know where I am going and you know the way.’
\p
\v 5 Thomas said to him, ‘Lord, we do not know where you are going, so how can we know the way?’
\p
\v 6 Jesus told him, ‘I AM the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
\v 7 If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. But from now on you do know him and you have seen him.’
\p
\v 8 Philip said to him, ‘Lord, show us the Father and that will satisfy us.’
\p
\v 9 Jesus said to him, ‘I have been with you for some time, Philip. Do you not know me? The one who has seen me has seen the Father, so what do you mean by saying, “Show us the Father”?
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak to you are not spoken on my own account, but are from the Father who is in me; he is doing the works.
\v 11 Believe me, that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe me because of the works themselves.
\v 12 Truly, truly I tell you that those who believe in me will also do the works that I am doing. Indeed, they will perform greater works than these because I am going to my Father.
\v 13 And if you ask anything in my name, I shall do it so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 Whatever you ask in my name I shall do.
\p
\v 15 If you love me, keep my commandments
\v 16 and I shall ask the Father who will give you another advocate to be with you for ever,
\v 17 the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him, but you know him because he is present with you and will be in you.
\v 18 I shall not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you.
\v 19 In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you too will live.
\v 20 On that day you will understand that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you.
\v 21 Those who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me, and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I shall love them and reveal myself to them.’
\p
\v 22 Judas, not Iscariot, asked him, ‘Lord, what has happened that you intend to reveal yourself to us but not to the world?’
\p
\v 23 Jesus replied, telling him, ‘Those who love me will hold fast to my word, and my Father will love them; and we shall come to them and make a place to live in them.
\v 24 Those who do not love me do not hold fast to my words, although the message that you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
\v 25 I have said this to you while I am with you,
\v 26 but the Advocate, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all that I have told you.

\v 27 ‘Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I give to you not in the way that the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor let them be afraid.

\v 28 You have heard me say to you, “I am going away, and I am returning to you.” If you loved me, you would rejoice that I said that I am going to the Father, for my Father is greater than I.
\v 29 And now I have told you before it happens so that when it does happen you may believe.
\v 30 I shall no longer say much to you, for the ruler of the world is coming. He is nothing to me,

\v 1 When Jesus had said this, he raised his eyes to heaven, saying, ‘Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that your Son may also glorify you,
\v 2 for you have given him authority over all flesh to give everlasting life to all whom you have given him.
\v 3 And this is everlasting life: that they may know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent, Jesus Christ.
\pi
\v 4 ‘I have glorified you on the earth; I have completed the work you gave me to do.
\v 5 And now, Father, glorify me beside yourself with the glory I had at your side before the world came to be.
\v 6 I have revealed your name to those whom you gave me from the world. They were yours and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
\v 7 Now they know that everything, all you that you have given me, is from you,
\v 8 for I have given them the words you gave to me and they have accepted them. They truly understand that I came from your side, and they believe that you sent me.
\v 9 I am asking on their behalf. I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you gave me, because they are yours.
\v 10 All that is mine is yours and yours is mine, and I am glorified in them.
\pi
\v 11 ‘I am to be no longer in the world, for I am coming to you. But they are in the world. Holy Father, watch over those whom you gave me in your name so that they, like us, may be one.
\v 12 While I was with them in the world, I watched over them in your name. Those whom you gave me I have kept safe and none of them has been lost, except the son of perdition so that the Scripture may be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I am coming to you. And I am saying these things in the world so that they may have my joy made perfect in them.
\v 14 I have given them your word, but the world hates them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
\v 15 I am not asking that you take them out of the world, but that you guard them from the evil one.
\v 16 They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.
\v 18 As you sent me into the world, I too sent them into the world.
\v 19 And for their sake I sanctify myself so that they may also be sanctified in truth.
\pi
\v 20 ‘I am not asking only on their behalf, but also on behalf of those who believe in me because of what they say,
\v 21 so that they may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I in you, may they also be one with us so that the world may believe that you sent me.
\v 22 And the glory that you gave to me I have given to them so that they may be one, just as we are one:
\v 23 I in them and you in me. May they be completely one so that the world may know that you sent me, and that you love them as you love me.
\v 24 Father, I want those whom you have given me to be with me as well, where I am, so that they may see the glory you have given to me because you have loved me from before the foundation of the world.
\pi
\v 25 ‘Righteous Father, truly the world does not know you, but I know you and these know that you sent me.
\v 26 I have made your name known to them, and I shall make it known so that the love with which you love me may be in them, and I in them.’

\c 18
\v 1 When he had said this, Jesus went out with his disciples to beyond the Kedron gully where there was a garden. He went into it, he and his disciples.
\v 2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples.
\v 3 And so Judas took a cohort of soldiers and officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
\v 4 Jesus knew everything that was to happen to him. He stepped forward and said to them, ‘For whom are you searching?’
\p
\v 5 They told him, ‘Jesus of Nazareth.’
\p Jesus said to them, ‘I AM.’ Judas, who betrayed him, was standing there with them.
\v 6 When he said to them, ‘I AM,’ they backed off and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Then Jesus asked them again, ‘For whom are you searching?’
\p They answered, ‘Jesus of Nazareth.’
\p
\v 8 Jesus replied, ‘I have told you that I AM. If you are looking for me, then let these go.’
\v 9 This was to fulfil what he had said: “Of those whom you have given to me, I did not lose one.”
\p
\v 10 Simon Peter who had a sword then drew it and struck the High Priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
\v 11 But Jesus told Peter, ‘Put the sword in its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?’
\p
\v 12 The cohort and the military commander and the Jewish officials then seized Jesus and bound him
\v 13 and led him away, first to Annas because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.
\v 14 It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.
\p
\v 15 Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That other disciple was known to the High Priest, and so he went in with Jesus into the High Priest’s courtyard,
\v 16 but Peter was standing outside at the door. The other disciple, the one known to the High Priest, then went out and spoke to the woman on the door and brought Peter in.
\v 17 The girl, the door-keeper, asked Peter, ‘Are you also one of this man’s disciples?’
\p He said, ‘I am not.’
\p
\v 18 The servants and officials standing there had made a charcoal fire because it was cold. They were warming themselves, and Peter stood with them, warming himself.
\p
\v 19 Then the High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered him, ‘I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the Temple where the Jews congregate at all times, and I have said nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why are you asking me? Ask those who have heard what I said to them. You see these people? They know what I have said.’
\p
\v 22 When Jesus said this, one of the officials standing there gave him a slap, saying, ‘Is this how you reply to the High Priest?’
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered him, ‘If I have spoken wrongly, charge me with the wrong; but if honestly, why are you striking me?’
\p
\v 24 Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was standing warming himself, they asked him, ‘Are you one of his disciples as well?’
\p He denied it, saying, ‘I am not.’
\p
\v 26 One of the High Priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, ‘Did I not see you in the garden with him?’
\p
\v 27 Peter again denied it, and immediately a cock crowed.
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early morning, and they themselves did not go into the Praetorium in order not to be made unclean so that they might eat the Passover.
\v 29 Therefore Pilate went out to them and asked, ‘What charge do you bring against this man?’
\p
\v 30 In reply they said to him, ‘If he were not a criminal, we should not have committed him to you.’
\p
\v 31 And Pilate told them, ‘Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.’
\p But the Jews replied, ‘It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.’
\v 32 This was to fulfil the words Jesus had spoken when he indicated the kind of death he was going to die.
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium. He summoned Jesus and said to him, ‘Are you the King of the Jews?’
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered him, ‘Are you yourself saying this, or have others told you about me?’
\p
\v 35 Pilate replied, ‘I am not a Jew, am I? Your own people, the chief priests no less, have handed you over to me. What have you done?’
\p
\v 36 Jesus answered, ‘My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, those who attend me would have fought to prevent me being betrayed to the Jews. But as it is, my Kingdom is not from here.’
\p
\v 37 Pilate then said to him, ‘So you are a king?’
\p Jesus replied, ‘It is as you say, because I am a king. I was born for this and I came into the world for this, so that I might testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the Truth listens to my voice.’
\p
\v 38 Pilate said to him, ‘What is truth?’ And having said that, he went out again to the Jews and told them, ‘I find no case against him.
\v 39 But you have a custom that I should release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me therefore to release for you the King of the Jews?’
\p
\v 40 But they all shouted back, saying, ‘Not this man, but Barabbas.’ Now Barabbas was a bandit.
\p
\c 19
\v 1 Pilate then took Jesus and flogged him.
\v 2 The soldiers plaited a crown from thorns, placed it on his head and put a purple robe around him.
\v 3 They were saying, ‘Hail, King of the Jews,’ while hitting him.
\p
\v 4 Pilate went outside again and told them, ‘Listen, I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I find no case against him.’
\v 5 And then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. He said to them, ‘You see the man.’
\p
\v 6 When the chief priests and the officials saw him they shouted out, saying, ‘Crucify! Crucify him!’
\p Pilate told them, ‘You take him and you crucify him, for I find no case against him.’
\p
\v 7 The Jews replied, ‘We have a law, and according to our law he should die because he has appointed himself Son of God.’
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate heard these words he was even more afraid,
\v 9 and going back into the Praetorium he asked Jesus, ‘Where are you from?’ But Jesus gave him no answer.
\v 10 Then Pilate said to him, ‘Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have the power to crucify you, and I have the power to release you?’
\p
\v 11 Jesus replied, ‘You would have no power over me at all if it had not been given to you from above. That is why the one who handed me over to you carries the greater sin.’
\p
\v 12 From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews were shouting out, saying, ‘If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who makes himself king is rejecting Caesar.’
\p
\v 13 On hearing these words Pilate brought Jesus outside and sat in judgement at a place called The Pavement, or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\p
\v 14 Now it was about the sixth hour on the Day of Preparation for the Passover, and he said to the Jews, ‘You see your king.’
\p
\v 15 But they shouted out, ‘Away with him! Take him away! Crucify him!’
\p Pilate said to them, ‘Shall I crucify your king?’
\p The chief priests replied, ‘We have no king but Caesar.’
\p
\v 16 He then handed him over to them to be crucified.
\p They took Jesus and led him away.
\v 17 And lifting up his cross he went out to what is called The Place of a Skull; its name in Hebrew is Golgotha.
\v 18 There they crucified him, and with him were two others who were on either side with Jesus in the middle.
\v 19 Pilate wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, ‘Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.’
\v 20 Now many of the Jews read this inscription because the place where Jesus was crucified was close to the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.
\v 21 And so the Jewish chief priests said to Pilate, ‘Do not write, “The King of the Jews,” but, “This man said, I am King of the Jews.”’
\p
\v 22 Pilate replied, ‘What I have written, I have written.’
\p
\v 23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and made four lots: a share for each soldier; then the cloak, but the cloak was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.
\v 24 They said to one another, ‘Let us not tear it. Instead, let us draw for whose it will be.’ This was to fulfil the Scripture which says, “They divided my clothes among them, and for my garment they threw dice.”\rq Psalms 21[22]:18\rq* That was indeed what the soldiers did.
\p
\v 25 Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, ‘Woman, you see your son.’
\v 27 Then he said to the disciple, ‘You see your mother.’ And from that moment the disciple took her as his own.
\p
\v 28 After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, to fulfil the Scripture Jesus said, ‘I am thirsty.’\rq See Psalms 21[22]:16\rq*
\v 29 Now a jar full of sour wine was provided, and so they filled a sponge with the sour wine, put it on a hyssop stalk, and held it up to his mouth.
\v 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine he said, ‘It has been accomplished.’ Then he bowed his head and offered up his spirit.
\p
\v 31 Since it was the Day of Preparation, in order that they should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for that Sabbath was an important day, the Jews asked Pilate that the legs might be broken and the bodies removed.
\v 32 The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and then the other of those crucified with him.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
\v 34 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out.
\v 35 And he who witnessed it has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth so that you too may believe,
\v 36 for these things took place in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled: ‘Not a bone of him will be broken.’\rq Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12; Psalms 33[34]:20\rq*
\v 37 And again, another Scripture says, ‘They will look upon him whom they pierced.’\rq Zechariah 12:10\rq*
\p
\v 38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he might remove Jesus’ body; and Pilate gave his permission. He then came and took away the body of Jesus.
\v 39 Nicodemus also came, the one who had earlier gone to Jesus by night. He brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
\v 40 They took the body of Jesus and they bound it with the spices in linen cloths in preparation for burial, as is the custom of the Jews.
\p
\v 41 In the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
\v 42 Because it was the Day of Preparation for the Jews, and because the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
\p
\c 20
\v 1 On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene arrived at the tomb early, while it was still dark, and she saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb.
\v 2 Then she ran, and going to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, she told them, ‘They have taken the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him.’
\p
\v 3 And so Peter and the other disciple set off, and as they were nearing the tomb,
\v 4 with the two running together, the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first.
\v 5 Stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
\v 6 Then Simon Peter arrived after him, and he went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there,
\v 7 with the towel that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but separately, folded up in its own place.
\v 8 Only then did the other disciple, who had arrived at the tomb first, go in as well. And he saw, and he believed.
\v 9 For as yet they did not understand the Scripture that he must rise again from the dead.
\p
\v 10 The disciples then left and went home again,
\v 11 but Mary stayed close to the tomb, weeping outside. As she cried, she leant into the tomb
\v 12 and saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\v 13 They said to her, ‘Woman, why are you weeping?’
\p She told them, ‘Because they have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him.’
\v 14 Saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, why are you weeping? For whom are you looking?’
\p She, thinking he was the gardener, said to him, ‘Sir, if you have moved him, tell me where you have laid him and I shall take him away.’
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to her, ‘Mary.’
\p She turned and said to him, ‘Rabbouni!’ That is to say, ‘Teacher!’
\p
\v 17 Jesus told her, ‘Do not hold on to me for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.”’
\p
\v 18 Mary Magdalene went, bringing the news to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
\p
\v 19 It was the evening of that day, the first of the week, and where the disciples were gathered the doors were shut for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them, and he said to them, ‘Peace be with you.’
\v 20 When he said this he showed them his hands and his side, and on seeing the Lord the disciples rejoiced.
\p
\v 21 Once again Jesus said, ‘Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.’
\v 22 Saying this, he breathed on them and said to them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 23 If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone’s, they are retained.’
\p
\v 24 Thomas, one of the Twelve who is called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came,
\v 25 and so the other disciples told him, ‘We have seen the Lord.’
\p But he answered them, ‘Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger on the mark of the nails, and put my hand against his side, I shall not believe.’
\p
\v 26 Eight days later his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors were shut, and he stood among them and said, ‘Peace be with you.’
\v 27 Then he said to Thomas, ‘Place your finger here and look at my hands; then move your hand and put it against my side. Do not be unbelieving, but believe.’
\p
\v 28 Thomas replied, saying to him, ‘My Lord and my God.’
\p
\v 29 Jesus told him, ‘Because you have seen me you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen but believe.’
\p
\v 30 Now Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this book,
\v 31 but these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
\p
\c 21
\v 1 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.
\p
\v 2 Simon Peter, and Thomas called The Twin, and Nathanael of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two of his other disciples were together.
\v 3 Simon Peter said to them, ‘I am going fishing.’
\p They replied, ‘We too; we are coming with you.’
\p Getting into the boat, they set out immediately, but that night they caught nothing.
\v 4 As day was dawning, Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 5 Then Jesus asked them, ‘Children, have you anything to eat?’
\p They answered him, ‘No.’
\p
\v 6 He told them, ‘Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find something.’
\p They made a cast, but then could not draw it in because of the huge number of fish.
\v 7 And that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’
\p When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he put on his coat, for he had stripped, and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 But the other disciples came by boat, towing the net of fish, for they were not far from the land, perhaps a hundred yards\f +\fr 21:8\ft The Greek is ‘two hundred cubits’\f* off.
\p
\v 9 When they came ashore they saw a charcoal fire spread out with fish lying on it, and bread.
\v 10 Jesus told them, ‘Bring some of the fish you have just caught.’
\v 11 Simon Peter went on board and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three of them, and though there were so many the net was not torn.
\v 12 Jesus said to them, ‘Come and have breakfast.’
\p None of the disciples dared ask him, ‘Who are you?’ They knew that it was the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus came and took the bread. He gave it to them, and the fish in the same way.
\v 14 This was now the third time after he had risen from the dead that Jesus was revealed to his disciples.
\p
\v 15 After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon son of Jonah, do you love\f +\fr 21:15-17 \ft Two Greek verbs meaning ‘to love’ appear in these verses. The two sometimes carry a subtle distinction of meaning, but sometimes not. John Chrysostom, commenting on this passage, does not draw attention to the vocabulary.\f* me more than these?’
\p He told him, ‘Yes, Lord. You know that I love you.’
\p He said to him, ‘Feed my lambs.’
\p
\v 16 He asked him again, a second time, ‘Simon son of Jonah, do you love me?’
\p Peter replied, ‘Yes, Lord. You know that I love you.’
\p He said to him, ‘Tend my sheep.’
\p
\v 17 He asked him a third time, ‘Simon son of Jonah, do you love me?’
\p Peter was distressed because he asked him for a third time, ‘Do you love me?’ and he said, ‘Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.’
\p Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep.
\pi
\v 18 ‘Truly, truly I tell you that when you were young you would dress yourself and go wherever you wanted. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you, and they will carry you where you would rather not go.’
\v 19 He said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God. And after he had said that, he told him, ‘Follow me.’
\p
\v 20 Turning around, Peter saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following. He was the one who at supper had leant on his breast and asked, ‘Lord, who is it that is betraying you?’
\v 21 Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, ‘Lord, what about this man?’
\p
\v 22 Jesus answered him, ‘If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You are to follow me.’
\v 23 This saying then spread among the brothers and sisters that the disciple would not die, although Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, ‘If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?’
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple who bears witness to these things and has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
\v 25 There are also many other things that Jesus did. If they were to be recorded individually, I do not think that the world itself would accommodate the books written.
\p Amen.
\p
