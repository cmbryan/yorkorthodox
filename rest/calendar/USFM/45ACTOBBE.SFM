\c 1
\v 1 The first account I gave, Theophilus, was about all that Jesus did and taught
\v 2 until the day on which he was taken up. He had given instructions through the Holy Spirit to the Apostles whom he had chosen,
\v 3 and to whom he presented himself alive by many proofs after his suffering. For forty days he was seen by them and spoke of matters concerning the Kingdom of God.
\v 4 While he was with them he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, ‘But wait for the Father’s promise which you heard about from me.
\v 5 John baptised with water, but after not many days you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.’
\p
\v 6 When they came together they asked him, ‘Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?’
\p
\v 7 And he told them, ‘It is not for you to know the times and seasons that the Father has set on his own authority,
\v 8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.’
\p
\v 9 When he had said this he was taken up as they watched and a cloud received him from their sight.
\v 10 After he had gone they were staring up into the sky, and two men clothed in white appeared and stood beside them.
\v 11 They said, ‘Men, Galileans, why do you stand gazing up at the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you saw him going into heaven.’
\p
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey.
\p
\v 13 When they arrived they went to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
\v 14 All these, as one, were attending diligently to prayer and petition, together with the women including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.
\p
\v 15 In those days Peter stood up among the disciples (the roll call was about a hundred and twenty) and he said,
\v 16 ‘Men, brothers and sisters, it was necessary to fulfil the Scripture that the Holy Spirit had earlier spoken through the mouth of David concerning Judas, he who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus,
\v 17 though he was numbered among us and had received his share in this ministry.’
\p
\v 18 With the wages of his iniquity this man had bought a plot of land, but, falling face down he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.
\v 19 It became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and consequently that place is called Akeldama in their own language, that is, Field of Blood.
\pi
\v 20 ‘As it is written in the book of Psalms, “Let his habitation become a wilderness and let no one live in it,” and, “Let another accept his responsibility.”\rq Psalms 68[69]:25, 108[109]:8\rq*
\v 21 It is necessary therefore, from the men who were with us for the whole time that the Lord Jesus came and went among us,
\v 22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us, for one of these to become a witness with us to his resurrection.’
\p
\v 23 And they put forward two: Joseph called Barsabbas who was also called Justus, and Matthias.
\v 24 Then they prayed, saying, ‘Lord, you know the heart of everyone; reveal which one of these two you have chosen
\v 25 to receive the share in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his proper place.’
\v 26 They cast their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven Apostles.
\p
\c 2
\v 1 When the Day of Pentecost arrived they were all together in the same place.
\v 2 And suddenly there came from heaven a roar like a raging violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
\v 3 Then something like separated tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them,
\v 4 and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages in accordance with what the Spirit was giving them to say.
\p
\v 5 Living in Jerusalem were Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven;
\v 6 and when this noise began, a crowd gathered. But they were mystified because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
\v 7 They were all beside themselves with amazement, saying to one another, ‘Listen, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
\v 8 How is it then that we are each hearing our own mother tongue?
\v 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those living in Mesopotamia as well as Judaea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia;
\v 10 and also Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the coast of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome: Jews, but also proselytes;
\v 11 Cretans and Arabians. In our own languages we have heard them saying great things about God.’
\v 12 They were all astonished and bewildered, saying to one another, ‘What does this mean?’
\v 13 But others, jeering, said, ‘They are full of new wine.’
\p
\v 14 Then Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them. ‘Men, Jews, and every resident of Jerusalem, understand this and listen to what I am saying,
\v 15 for these men are not drunk as you suppose. It is only the third hour of the day!
\v 16 No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel,
\v 17 “In the last days, says God, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams.
\v 18 Yes, in those days I will pour out my Spirit upon my male and female servants also, and they shall prophesy.
\v 19 I will show wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire and clouds of smoke.
\v 20 The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and spectacular Day of the Lord.
\v 21 And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”\rq Joel 2:28-32\rq*
\pi
\v 22 ‘Men, Israelites, listen to these words. Jesus of Nazareth was a man revealed to you by God and by the miracles and wonders and signs that God worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know.
\v 23 This is he who by the ordained purpose and forethought of God was given up and seized by the hands of lawless men. He is the one whom you killed, crucifying him.
\v 24 It is he whom God has raised up, releasing the clutches of death because it was not possible that he should be gripped by it.
\v 25 For David says of him, “I saw the Lord always in my presence, for he is at my right hand and I shall not be moved.
\v 26 Because of this my heart was cheered and my tongue rejoiced, and from now on my flesh will be rooted in hope.
\v 27 For you will not abandon my soul in Hades, nor will you allow your Holy One to experience corruption.
\v 28 You have shown me the paths of life. You will fill me with joy through your presence.”\rq Psalms 15[16]:8-11\rq*
\pi
\v 29 ‘Men, brothers, it is possible to speak to you confidently about the patriarch David: that he died and was buried, and that his tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 But being a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him that from the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up the Christ to sit upon his throne.
\v 31 Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul would not be left in Hades nor would his flesh experience corruption.
\v 32 This Jesus, God has raised up; of this we are all witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore, since he is exalted at the right hand of God and has received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has now poured out what you see and hear.
\v 34 For David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself declared, “The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand
\v 35 until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.”\rq Psalms 109[110]:1\rq*
\v 36 Let the whole house of Israel be assured then, that God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ.’
\p
\v 37 On hearing this they were pierced to the heart, and they asked Peter and the other Apostles, ‘Men, brothers, what are we to do?’
\p
\v 38 And Peter told them, ‘Repent and be baptised, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God shall call.’
\v 40 With many other words he testified, and he urged them, saying, ‘Save yourselves from this perverse generation.’
\v 41 Then those who gladly accepted his message were baptised, and about three thousand souls were added on that day.
\p
\v 42 They continued to devote themselves to the Apostles’ teaching, and to the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers.
\v 43 Fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were performed through the Apostles.
\v 44 All those who believed were together and they held everything in common.
\v 45 They were selling possessions and property and sharing with everyone, according to each person’s need.
\v 46 Day by day, as one, they devoted themselves to the Temple and to the breaking of bread at home. They took their meals with gladness and with simplicity of heart,
\v 47 praising God. They were favourably regarded by all the people, and day by day the Lord was adding to the Church those who were being saved.
\p
\c 3
\v 1 Peter and John were going up to the Temple together at the ninth hour for prayer,
\v 2 and a man, lame from his mother’s womb, was being carried along. Every day they would lay him at what was called the Beautiful Gate of the Temple to beg for alms from those entering the Temple.
\p
\v 3 On seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple he asked for alms.
\v 4 With John beside him, Peter fixed his eyes on him and said, ‘Look at us.’
\v 5 He showed interest in them, expecting to receive something from them,
\v 6 but Peter said, ‘I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk.’
\v 7 Seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.
\v 8 Then springing up, he stood and walked; and he went with them into the Temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
\p
\v 9 When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
\v 10 and recognised that it was the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
\v 11 As the lame man who had been healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran up to them in the colonnade known as Solomon’s, utterly astounded.
\v 12 Seeing this, Peter began to speak to the people.
\p ‘Men, Israelites, why are you so astonished by this? Why are you staring at us as though it was by our own power or holiness that we made him walk?
\v 13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and disowned before Pilate when he had passed judgement to release him.
\v 14 But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One, and begged for a man, a murderer, to be pardoned for you.
\v 15 Then you killed the Author of Life whom God has raised from the dead. We are witnesses to this.
\v 16 And through faith in his name, that name of his has strengthened this man whom you see and recognise; yes, the faith that is from him has given him this perfect health in front of you all.
\pi
\v 17 ‘Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders,
\v 18 but in this way God has fulfilled what he had already announced through the mouths of all his prophets: that the Christ should suffer.
\v 19 Repent, therefore, and turn back so that your sins may be wiped clean, so that opportunities for revival may come from the presence of the Lord,
\v 20 and so that he may send Christ Jesus, the one already chosen for you,
\v 21 the one whom heaven must receive until the times when all things are restored, of which God spoke long ago through the mouths of all his holy prophets.
\v 22 Moses, for instance, told the ancestors, “The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You are to listen to everything, whatever he tells you;
\v 23 and it will be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet will be completely rooted out from among the people.”\rq Deuteronomy 18:15,18-19\rq*
\v 24 For all the prophets who preached, from Samuel and those who followed, have also given notice of these days.
\pi
\v 25 ‘You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our ancestors, saying to Abraham, “Through your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”\rq Genesis 22:18; 26:4\rq*
\v 26 After raising up his servant Jesus, God sent him to you first, blessing you as each of you turns away from your evil ways.’
\p
\c 4
\v 1 As they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees confronted them,
\v 2 aggrieved that they were teaching the people and preaching through Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
\v 3 They arrested them and kept them in custody until the following day, for it was already evening.
\v 4 But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of men came to about five thousand.
\p
\v 5 The next morning their rulers and the elders and the scribes assembled in Jerusalem with
\v 6 Annas, the High Priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and whoever else was related to the High Priest.
\v 7 Placing them at the centre, they demanded, ‘By what power, or in whose name, did you do this?’
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, ‘Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,
\v 9 if we are being questioned today concerning a good deed done to an invalid, and by whom he has been healed,
\v 10 all of you and all the people of Israel should know that it is in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead. It is through him that this man stands before you healthy.
\v 11 He is the stone despised by you, the builders, that became the chief cornerstone.\rq See Psalms 117[118]:22\rq*
\v 12 And there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given to us by which we must be saved.’
\p
\v 13 When they saw the assurance of Peter and John and realised that they were uneducated and common men, they were astonished. They also knew that they had been with Jesus.
\v 14 But seeing the man who had been healed standing beside them, they found nothing to say against them.
\v 15 They dismissed them from the Sanhedrin and conferred among themselves,
\v 16 saying, ‘What shall we do with these men? That a remarkable miracle has been performed through them is evident to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
\v 17 But so that it may spread no further among the people, let us sternly forbid them to speak again to anyone in this name.’
\v 18 Then, summoning them, they charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and John responded, telling them, ‘Whether it is right before God to listen to you rather than to God, you decide;
\v 20 for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.’
\p
\v 21 After they had issued further threats they let them go, finding no way to punish them on account of the people, for everyone was glorifying God for what had happened
\v 22 because the man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.
\p
\v 23 On being released, they went to their companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
\v 24 When they heard, they raised a united cry to God, saying, ‘Master, you are the maker of heaven and earth and of the sea and everything in them.
\v 25 You said through the mouth of your servant David, “Why do the nations rage and the peoples entertain vanities?
\v 26 The kings of the earth made a stand, and the rulers came together against the Lord and against his Anointed One.”\rq Psalms 2:1-2\rq*
\v 27 For truly, ranged against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, were both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the nations and the peoples of Israel
\v 28 to do whatever your hand and your purpose had ordained in advance should happen.
\v 29 But now, Lord, look at their threats and grant that your servants may proclaim your word with confidence
\v 30 as you stretch out your hand for healing, and for signs and wonders to take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’
\p
\v 31 Then when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and proclaimed the word of God with confidence.
\p
\v 32 The whole company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and none of them was saying that what they had was their own, but everything for them was shared by all.
\v 33 And with great power the Apostles testified to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and grace in abundance was upon them all.
\v 34 No one was in need, because those among them who owned land or property sold it, bringing the proceeds of what had been sold
\v 35 and laying it at the feet of the Apostles. Then it was distributed to each person, according to the need of each.
\p
\v 36 Joses, to whom the Apostles gave the name Barnabas, which means Son of Encouragement, was a Levite, a Cypriot by birth.
\v 37 He sold a field that was his, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the Apostles.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 One man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a property.
\v 2 He kept back some of the proceeds, and his wife was aware of this, but he brought a portion and laid it at the feet of the Apostles.
\v 3 And Peter said, ‘Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the proceeds from the plot of land?
\v 4 As it was, did it not remain your own? And once sold, was it not under your control? Why did you conceive this scheme in your heart? You have not lied to human beings, but to God.’
\p
\v 5 On hearing these words Ananias fell to the ground and breathed his last, and a great fear came upon all who heard these things.
\v 6 The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him out and buried him.
\p
\v 7 Now about three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
\v 8 Peter said to her, ‘Tell me, was it for this amount that you sold the land?’
\p And she replied, ‘Yes, for that amount.’
\p
\v 9 Then Peter said to her, ‘How is it that you have conspired to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.’
\p
\v 10 Instantly she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. Then the young men came in, found her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
\v 11 And a great fear fell upon the whole Church and upon all who heard these things.
\p
\v 12 At the hands of the Apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people. They were all together in Solomon’s Colonnade
\v 13 and no one else dared keep company with them, though the people spoke highly of them.
\v 14 More believers were being added to the Lord, large numbers of both men and women.
\v 15 They were even carrying the sick out into the streets and laying them on beds and mattresses so that as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them.
\v 16 Large numbers were also flocking into Jerusalem from the towns round about, carrying the sick and those disturbed by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
\p
\v 17 Rising up, the High Priest and everyone with him, that is, the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with indignation.
\v 18 They stretched out their hands against the Apostles and committed them to the public prison.
\v 19 During the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out, saying,
\v 20 ‘Go, stand in the Temple and proclaim to the people the whole message of this life.’
\v 21 They obeyed, and entering the Temple at daybreak they began to teach.
\p Meanwhile the High Priest appeared with his associates, and they convened the Sanhedrin with the whole Council of the Sons of Israel. Then they sent to the prison to have them brought,
\v 22 but when the officers arrived they did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,
\v 23 saying, ‘We found the prison locked and completely secure with the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened up we found no one inside.’
\p
\v 24 On hearing these words, the High Priest and the captain of the Temple and the chief priests were baffled by them, by how this might end.
\v 25 Then someone arrived bringing them news: ‘Listen, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the Temple and teaching the people.’
\v 26 The captain then went with his officers and fetched them without using force, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.
\p
\v 27 They brought them into the presence of the Sanhedrin, and the High Priest questioned them.
\v 28 He said, ‘Did we not charge you with an order not to teach in this name? And yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.’
\p
\v 29 In reply, Peter and the Apostles said, ‘We must submit to God’s authority rather than that of human beings.
\v 30 The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging on a tree.
\v 31 This man, Prince and Saviour, God has raised to his right hand to grant repentance to Israel and the forgiveness of sins.
\v 32 And we are his witnesses in these matters, as is the Holy Spirit also whom God has given to those who obey him.’
\p
\v 33 On hearing this they were convulsed with fury, and they determined to do away with them.
\v 34 But a certain man in the Sanhedrin rose to his feet. He was a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law respected by all the people, and he ordered the Apostles briefly to be sent outside.
\v 35 Then he said to them, ‘Men of Israel, think carefully about these men and what you intend to do.
\v 36 Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be someone, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, gave their support. He was killed, and all those who were under his influence dispersed, and it came to nothing.
\v 37 After that, at the time of the census, Judas of Galilee appeared, and he drew over a good number of people to him. He, too, perished, and all those who were under his influence dispersed.
\v 38 Therefore, I now say to you, have nothing to do with these men and let them be, because if this purpose or work is human, it will crumble;
\v 39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to bring it down and you may even find yourselves fighting against God.’
\p
\v 40 They agreed with him, and having summoned the Apostles, they flogged them, ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.
\v 41 They went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin truly rejoicing, because for the sake of his name they had been considered worthy to suffer dishonour.
\p
\v 42 Every day, both in the Temple and at home, they did not cease from teaching and proclaiming Jesus to be the Christ.
\p
\c 6
\v 1 In those days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists began complaining about the Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.
\v 2 The Twelve called together the full company of the disciples and said, ‘It is not acceptable that we abandon the word of God to serve at tables.
\v 3 Therefore, brothers and sisters, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint for this necessary task,
\v 4 and we shall give ourselves totally to prayer and the ministry of the word.’
\p
\v 5 What was said pleased the whole company, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch,
\v 6 whom they presented to the Apostles. They then prayed and laid hands on them.
\p
\v 7 The word of God spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased substantially with large numbers of Jews becoming obedient to the faith.
\p
\v 8 Stephen, full of faith and power, was performing wonders and great signs among the people.
\v 9 However, from the Synagogue of the Freedmen, as it was called, there arose some Cyrenians and Alexandrians and those from Cilicia and Asia who argued with Stephen,
\v 10 but they were not able to stand up against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
\v 11 Then they induced men to say, ‘We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.’
\v 12 They also stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they confronted him, seized him, and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
\v 13 They produced false witnesses as well, who said, ‘This man never stops blaspheming against the Holy Place and against the Law,
\v 14 for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will demolish this place and change the customs that Moses has handed down to us.’
\v 15 Then, as they looked closely at him, all those sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his face as the face of an angel.
\p
\c 7
\v 1 The High Priest asked, ‘Is this really so?’
\p
\v 2 And he declared, ‘Men, brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived at Haran,
\v 3 and said to him, “Leave your land and your relatives and come here to that land which I shall show you.”\rq Genesis 12:1\rq*
\v 4 At that time he left the land of the Chaldaeans and settled at Haran; then from there, after the death of his father, he moved him to this land where you now live.
\v 5 He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foothold, but he promised to give it as a possession for him and for his descendants after him, though he had no child.
\v 6 Even so, God stated that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land, and would be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.
\v 7 But, “I shall judge the nation which they serve,” said God, “and after that they will come out, and they will worship me in this place.”\rq Genesis 15:13-14\rq*
\v 8 He gave him a covenant of circumcision, and after that he fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac fathered Jacob; and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.
\pi
\v 9 ‘The patriarchs, driven by jealousy, sold Joseph into Egypt; but God was with him
\v 10 and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave him grace and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and his entire household.
\v 11 A famine came upon the whole land of Egypt and Canaan with great suffering, and our ancestors could find no food.
\v 12 Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, sent our fathers for the first time;
\v 13 and on the second, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family was revealed to Pharaoh.
\v 14 Joseph sent and summoned his father Jacob and all his relatives, about seventy-five souls,
\v 15 and Jacob went down to Egypt. He died, he and our ancestors,
\v 16 and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor at Shechem.
\pi
\v 17 ‘And so it was that, as the time for the promise which God had sworn to Abraham was approaching, the people increased and became numerous in Egypt
\v 18 until a different king arose, who had not known Joseph.
\v 19 This one was devious in dealing with our nation, and he ill-treated our ancestors, forcing them to leave their new-born infants out in the open so that they should not live.
\v 20 At that time Moses was born, and he was pleasing to God; and for three months he was nursed in his father’s house.
\v 21 Then, when he was left outdoors, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.
\v 22 Moses received instruction in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in word and deed.
\v 23 But when he was forty years old he had it in his heart to go and see his brothers and sisters, the children of Israel.
\v 24 Observing one of them suffering unjustly, he defended and avenged the oppressed man, striking down the Egyptian.
\v 25 He supposed that his brothers and sisters understood that through his hand God was giving them deliverance, but they did not understand.
\pi
\v 26 ‘Then, on the following day he was seen by them as they were quarrelling, and he urged them to make peace, saying, “Men, you are brothers. Why are you unjust to one another?”
\v 27 But the one who was being unjust to his neighbour pushed him away, saying, “Who appointed you ruler and judge over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?”\rq Exodus 2:14\rq*
\v 29 At these words Moses fled; and he became an exile in the land of Midian where he fathered two sons.
\pi
\v 30 ‘After forty years had passed, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the Mount Sinai desert, in the flame of a blazing bush.
\v 31 When Moses saw it he was awestruck at the sight, and as he was going closer to see, the voice of the Lord came to him,
\v 32 “I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.”\rq Exodus 3:6\rq* And Moses was terrified and dare not look.
\v 33 The Lord said to him, “Untie your sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.
\v 34 Listen, I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt and heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Come, now; I shall send you to Egypt.”\rq Exodus 3:5,7-8,10\rq*

\v 35 ‘This Moses whom they rejected, saying, “Who appointed you ruler and judge?” was the one God sent as ruler and redeemer by the hand of an angel who appeared to him in the bush.
\v 36 It was this man who led them out. He performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and by the Red Sea, and for forty years in the wilderness.
\v 37 This is the Moses who said to the children of Israel, “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers; you shall listen to him.”\rq Deuteronomy 18:15\rq*
\v 38 It was he who was with the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors who received the words of life to give to us.
\pi
\v 39 ‘Our ancestors were not willing to be subject to him, but rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
\v 40 They said to Aaron, “Make us gods who will go before us, for we do not know what has become of this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt.”\rq Exodus 32:1\rq*
\v 41 And at that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, rejoicing in their handiwork.
\v 42 But God turned, and gave them up to the worship of heaven’s army as it is written in the book of the prophets, “Did you offer me slaughtered beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, House of Israel?
\v 43 No, you took with you the tent of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan, the images which you made to be reverenced. Therefore I shall exile you beyond Babylon.”\rq Amos 5:25-27 LXX\rq*
\pi
\v 44 ‘The Tent of Witness was with our ancestors in the wilderness, made as the one who spoke to Moses directed, in accordance with the design he had seen.
\v 45 It was then received in turn by our ancestors and brought in with Joshua into the territory of the nations whom God drove out before the face of our ancestors. And so it was until the time of David.
\v 46 He found favour in the sight of God and asked that a dwelling be found for the God of Jacob.
\v 47 Then Solomon built him a house.
\v 48 But the Most High does not live in sanctuaries made by hands. As the prophet says,
\v 49 “Heaven is my throne and the earth my footstool. What kind of house would you build for me,” says the Lord, “and where would I reside?
\v 50 Have my hands not made all of this?”\rq Isaiah 66:1-2\rq*
\pi
\v 51 ‘Obstinate people and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit. Yes you do, just like your ancestors.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers,
\v 53 you who received the law through the ministration of angels but did not keep it.’
\p
\v 54 When they heard this they were cut to the heart and ground their teeth at him.
\v 55 Filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
\v 56 He exclaimed, ‘Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.’
\p
\v 57 They cried out in a loud voice and covered their ears, and as one they rushed upon him.
\v 58 They threw him out of the city and began to stone him, while the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
\v 59 As they were stoning Stephen, he called out, saying, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.’
\v 60 Then falling to his knees, he cried in a loud voice, ‘Lord, do not hold this sin against them.’ On saying this, he fell asleep.
\p
\c 8
\v 1 Saul approved of his death, and on that day a great persecution came upon the Church in Jerusalem. Except for the Apostles they were all scattered throughout the provinces of Judaea and Samaria.
\v 2 Devout men carried Stephen away and made a great lamentation over him.
\v 3 Saul was causing havoc in the Church. He was going from house to house, dragging away both men and women and putting them in prison.
\v 4 But those who had been scattered were proclaiming the word everywhere they went.
\p
\v 5 Philip went down to a city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.
\v 6 The crowds paid close attention to what was said by Philip and they were as one as they listened and saw the signs he was performing,
\v 7 for unclean spirits howling with a great cry were coming out of many who were possessed, and many who were paralysed and unable to walk were healed.
\v 8 And there was great joy in that city.
\p
\v 9 But there was one man named Simon who claimed to be someone great and had previously captivated the people of Samaria using sorcery.
\v 10 From the least to the greatest they all took notice of him, saying, ‘This man is the Great Power of God.’
\v 11 They paid heed to him because he had bewitched them with his sorceries for quite some time,
\v 12 but when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the Gospel about the things concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.
\v 13 Simon himself also believed, and after being baptised he kept close to Philip. Seeing the miracles and signs taking place, he was astounded.
\p
\v 14 When the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
\v 15 These two came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
\v 16 for as yet the Spirit had fallen on none of them; they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 17 They then laid hands upon them and they received the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 When Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the Apostles’ hands, he offered them money.
\v 19 He said, ‘Give this power to me as well so that whoever I lay my hands upon may receive the Holy Spirit.’
\v 20 But Peter said to him, ‘Your silver be damned with you because you thought you could acquire God’s gift with money.
\v 21 For you there is no share, no inheritance, in this matter because your heart is not right before God.
\v 22 Repent of this evil of yours and beg God that somehow the intention in your heart may be forgiven you,
\v 23 for I see that you are under the poison of bitterness and the control of iniquity.’
\p
\v 24 In reply Simon said, ‘Pray on my behalf to God that none of the things you have said may come upon me.’
\p
\v 25 Then after they had testified at length and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, proclaiming the Gospel in many Samaritan villages.
\p
\v 26 An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, ‘Set out and travel southwards on the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.’
\p
\v 27 He set off and went, and there appeared a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch, a man of great authority under the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of her entire treasury. He had come to worship in Jerusalem
\v 28 and was now returning. He was seated in his chariot reading the prophet Isaiah.
\p
\v 29 The Spirit said to Philip, ‘Go up close and stay with this chariot.’
\p
\v 30 When Philip ran up he heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and he asked, ‘Do you understand what you are reading?’
\p
\v 31 He replied, ‘How can I unless someone guides me?’ And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
\p
\v 32 Now the passage of Scripture he was reading was this, ‘He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he does not open his mouth.
\v 33 In his humiliation justice was taken from him. Who will describe his generation? For his life is taken from the earth.’\rq Isaiah 53:7,8 LXX\rq*
\p
\v 34 Addressing Philip, the eunuch asked, ‘Please, about whom is the prophet saying this? About himself or about someone else?’
\v 35 Then Philip opened his mouth and beginning with this Scripture he proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus to him.
\p
\v 36 As they travelled along the road they came upon some water, and the eunuch said, ‘Look, there is water. What prevents me being baptised?’
\p
\v 37 Philip said, ‘If you believe with your whole heart, you may.’ 
\p And he replied, ‘I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.’
\p
\v 38 He ordered the chariot to stop and the two of them went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised him.
\v 39 Then when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch saw him no more, but he went on his way rejoicing.
\p
\v 40 Philip meanwhile was to be found at Azotus. He was proclaiming the Gospel as he passed through all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 Saul, still breathing menace and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the High Priest
\v 2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus so that if he found any who were of The Way, either men or women, he might bring them captive to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 On the journey he was approaching Damascus when suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.
\v 4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
\p
\v 5 He asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’
\p And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
\v 6 Now arise and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.’
\p
\v 7 The men travelling with him stood speechless. They heard the voice but saw no one.
\v 8 Saul got up from the ground, but on opening his eyes he could see nothing. Then, leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus
\v 9 and for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank.
\p
\v 10 Now there was at Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, ‘Ananias!’
\p And he replied, ‘I am here, Lord.’
\p
\v 11 The Lord told him, ‘Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas enquire by name for Saul of Tarsus. You see, he is praying
\v 12 and in a vision he has seen a man called Ananias coming in and laying a hand on him so that he may see again.’
\p
\v 13 And Ananias replied, ‘Lord, I have heard about this man from many people, of how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem
\v 14 and that he is here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.’
\p
\v 15 But the Lord told him, ‘Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before nations and kings as well as the children of Israel,
\v 16 and I shall show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.’
\p
\v 17 Ananias went and entered the house; then, laying hands upon him, he said, ‘Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.’
\v 18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he saw again. He arose and was baptised,
\v 19 and after accepting something to eat he was strengthened.
\p Saul was with the disciples in Damascus for some days.
\v 20 Soon he was in the synagogues preaching that Jesus was the Son of God,
\v 21 and all who heard him were amazed and were saying, ‘Is this not the man who dealt destruction to those invoking this name in Jerusalem? And has he not come here with the purpose of taking them away captive to the chief priests?’
\p
\v 22 But Saul was gaining in strength more and more, and he confounded the Jews living in Damascus, proving that this man was the Christ.
\p
\v 23 When several days had gone by the Jews conspired to do away with him,
\v 24 but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him,
\v 25 but the disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall, lowered in a basket.
\p
\v 26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
\v 27 Barnabas took him in hand and brought him to the Apostles, and he explained to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had been preaching openly in the name of Jesus.
\v 28 Then he was with them, coming and going in Jerusalem and preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 29 He was speaking and debating with the Hellenists, but they determined to do away with him.
\v 30 Aware of this, the brothers and sisters brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 Then the churches throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and were being built up. Living in the fear of the Lord and with the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, they were increasing in numbers.
\p
\v 32 Peter was travelling far and wide, and he went down to the saints who lived at Lydda.
\v 33 There he found a man named Aeneas who was paralysed, bedridden for eight years.
\v 34 Peter said to him, ‘Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and make your bed.’ And he stood up immediately.
\v 35 When all the inhabitants of Lydda and Sharon saw him they turned to the Lord.
\p
\v 36 There was a disciple at Joppa named Tabitha, it translates as Dorcas\f +\fr 9:36 \ft The name means Gazelle.\f*. This woman was full of good works and performed acts of mercy,
\v 37 but at that time she fell ill and died. They washed her and laid her in an upper room.
\p
\v 38 As Lydda was near Joppa, and hearing that Peter was there, the disciples sent two men to him to urge him not to delay in coming over to them.
\v 39 Peter set off and went with them. When he arrived they led him to the upper room, and all the widows stood around him, weeping and showing shirts and coats and everything that Dorcas used to make when she was with them.
\v 40 Peter sent them all outside, then knelt down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, ‘Tabitha, rise!’ She opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up.
\v 41 Giving her his hand, he raised her up, and calling out to the saints and widows he presented her alive.
\v 42 It became known throughout the whole of Joppa and many believed in the Lord.
\v 43 He stayed in Joppa for some days with someone called Simon, a tanner.
\p
\c 10
\v 1 At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort.
\v 2 He and his entire household were devout and God-fearing. He performed many acts of generosity for the people, and he was constantly in prayer to God.
\v 3 At about the ninth hour of the day he saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, ‘Cornelius!’
\p
\v 4 He stared at him and became fearful, and he asked, ‘What is it, lord?’
\p He replied, ‘Your prayers and your acts of generosity have gone up as a testimonial in the sight of God.
\v 5 Now send men to Joppa and summon the man Simon, the one also called Peter.
\v 6 He is lodging with a certain Simon the Tanner whose house is by the sea.’
\p
\v 7 When the angel speaking to Cornelius had departed, he summoned two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among his faithful attendants.
\v 8 He explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 The next day while these men were on the road and approaching the city, Peter went up to the housetop to pray; it was about midday.
\v 10 He became very hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it he fell into a trance.
\v 11 He saw heaven opened and a structure like a large sheet tied at the four corners descending towards him, being let down on to the earth.
\v 12 In it were all the four-footed animals of the earth, with the wild beasts and the small crawling things and the birds of the air.
\v 13 Then a voice came to him, ‘Rise, Peter. Kill and eat.’
\p
\v 14 But Peter said, ‘Oh no, Lord, for I have never eaten anything profane or unclean.’
\p
\v 15 The voice came to him again, a second time, ‘Do not call profane what God has made clean.’
\p
\v 16 This happened three times, then the structure was once again taken up into heaven.
\p
\v 17 While Peter was puzzling over what the vision he had seen might mean, the men sent by Cornelius had enquired for Simon’s house and were standing at the gate.
\v 18 They called out, asking whether Simon, also called Peter, was lodging there.
\v 19 Peter continued to reflect on the vision, and the Spirit said to him, ‘Listen. Three men are asking for you.
\v 20 Get up and go down and go with them. Do not hesitate, for I have sent them.’
\p
\v 21 Peter went down to the men and said, ‘I am the one you seek. What is the reason for your being here?’
\p
\v 22 They said, ‘Cornelius the centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man and well thought of by the whole nation of the Jews, was instructed by a holy angel to invite you to his house and to hear what you have to say.’
\v 23 He then invited them in and gave them lodging.
\p In the morning he got up and set off with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him.
\p
\v 24 On the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
\v 25 As Peter came to go in, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet and prostrated himself.
\v 26 But Peter raised him up, saying, ‘Stand up, for I am a fellow human being.’
\v 27 Then, as they talked together, he went in and found that many had assembled.
\v 28 He said to them, ‘You understand that it is against the law for a Jewish man to associate with or visit someone of another nation, but God has shown me that I am not to call anyone profane or unclean,
\v 29 and so I came without protest when I was sent for. I ask therefore, what is the reason you sent for me?’
\p
\v 30 Then Cornelius explained. ‘Until this time four days ago I had been fasting, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house when I saw standing in front of me a man clothed in white.
\v 31 He said, “Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your acts of generosity have been recalled in the presence of God.
\v 32 Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter. He is staying at the house of Simon the Tanner by the sea. When he comes he will speak to you.”
\v 33 I sent for you at once, and it was good of you to come. And now we are all present in the sight of God to hear everything that has been asked of you by God.’
\p
\v 34 Peter opened his mouth and said, ‘Truly I perceive that God does not show partiality,
\v 35 but in every nation those who fear him and are committed to righteousness are acceptable to him.
\v 36 The message he sent to the children of Israel announcing the Gospel of peace through Jesus Christ, he who is Lord of all,
\v 37 you know about. You know how the word came to all Judaea, starting from Galilee after the baptism that John preached,
\v 38 and how Jesus of Nazareth whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
\v 39 And we ourselves are witnesses of everything he did, both in the countryside of Judaea and in Jerusalem. But he, whom they put to death by hanging on a tree,
\v 40 God raised on the third day. He allowed him to appear,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses, to those who were chosen beforehand by God: we who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.
\v 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained of God as Judge of the living and of the dead.
\v 43 This is he to whom all the prophets bear witness. Through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.’
\p
\v 44 While Peter was still speaking of these matters the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the word,
\v 45 and those of the circumcision, the believers who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles
\v 46 because they heard them speaking in tongues and exalting God.
\p Then Peter said,
\v 47 ‘Is anyone able to withhold the water for these people to be baptised, these who have received the Holy Spirit just like us?’
\v 48 And he gave the order that they should be baptised in the name of the Lord. They then asked him to stay for some days.
\p
\c 11
\v 1 The Apostles and the brothers and sisters who were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God,
\v 2 and when Peter came up to Jerusalem those who were of the Circumcision criticized him,
\v 3 saying, ‘You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them.’
\p
\v 4 Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning. He said,
\v 5 ‘I was in the city of Joppa, praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. A structure like a great sheet was being let down from heaven by the four corners, and it descended until it reached me.
\v 6 As I looked closely at it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air.
\v 7 I also heard a voice saying to me, “Rise, Peter. Kill and eat.”
\v 8 But I said, “Oh no, Lord. For nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.”
\v 9 Then a second time the voice from heaven spoke to me: “Do not call profane what God has made clean.”
\v 10 This happened three times, then once more everything was taken up into heaven.
\v 11 At that very moment three men reached the house where I was. They had been sent to me from Caesarea.
\v 12 The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation, and these six brothers went with me as well. We entered the man’s house,
\v 13 and he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and telling him, “Send men to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter.
\v 14 He will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your household.”
\v 15 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as on us at the beginning,
\v 16 and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, “John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.”
\v 17 Therefore if God had given them the same gift that he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in the way of God?’
\p
\v 18 When they heard this they held their peace. And they glorified God, saying, ‘There is no doubt then that God has granted the repentance that leads to life to the Gentiles as well.’
\p
\v 19 Now those who were scattered by the persecution which came about over Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to no one except Jews.
\v 20 But some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene who arrived at Antioch, were speaking to the Hellenists, proclaiming the Gospel of the Lord Jesus,
\v 21 and the hand of the Lord was with them. A great number believed and turned to the Lord.
\p
\v 22 A report about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to go all the way to Antioch.
\v 23 When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced. He encouraged them all to stay close to the Lord with firm purpose of heart,
\v 24 for he was a good man full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a considerable company was added to the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul,
\v 26 and when he found him he brought him to Antioch. And so it was that for a whole year they met together with the church and taught a large number of people. It was at Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus stood up and indicated through the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout the whole world, which happened in the time of Claudius Caesar.
\v 29 The disciples determined according to the means of each to send relief to the brothers and sisters living in Judaea,
\v 30 and this they did, sending it to the presbyters by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
\p
\c 12
\v 1 At that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to inflict evil upon some of those in the Church.
\v 2 He put to the sword James the brother of John,
\v 3 and when he saw that this pleased the Jews he went further. During the Days of Unleavened Bread he also took Peter
\v 4 whom he arrested and put in prison, handing him over to four squads of four soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.
\v 5 While Peter was being held in prison fervent prayer to God was being kept up by the Church on his behalf.
\p
\v 6 The very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, and in front of the gate sentries were guarding the prison.
\v 7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord was there and a light shone in the cell. Prodding Peter in the ribs, he roused him saying, ‘Get up quickly.’ And his chains fell from his hands.
\v 8 The angel then said to him, ‘Get dressed and put on your sandals,’ and he did so. Then he told him, ‘Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.’
\v 9 He set off and followed him, but he did not realise that what the angel was doing was real; he supposed he was seeing a vision.
\v 10 When they had passed through the first and second guardrooms they arrived at the iron gate leading out into the city, and it opened for them of its own accord. Going through it, they continued down one street and then the angel suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 Peter came to himself and said, ‘Now I know it is true that the Lord sent his angel, and that he has rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.’
\v 12 Realising this, he went to the home of Mary, the mother of John who is also called Mark, where many had gathered and were praying.
\v 13 He knocked at the outer gate and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
\v 14 When she recognised Peter’s voice, from sheer joy she did not open the door but ran inside and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.
\v 15 They said to her, ‘You are mad!’ But she insisted that it was so. They said, ‘It is his angel.’
\p
\v 16 Peter carried on knocking. When they did open the door and saw him they were astonished,
\v 17 but with his hand he signalled to them to be quiet. He explained to them how the Lord had brought him out from the prison, and he said, ‘Take word of this to James and the brothers and sisters.’ Then he left and went somewhere else.
\p
\v 18 When day dawned there was no small uproar among the soldiers. What had become of Peter?
\v 19 Herod searched, but failed to find him. He questioned the guards and ordered that they be led away; and then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea where he remained.
\p
\v 20 Herod was furiously angry with the Tyrians and Sidonians. They agreed to approach him together, and having befriended Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they sued for peace because their territory was provisioned by that of the king.
\v 21 On an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in regal apparel, sat upon the throne, and made a speech to them.
\v 22 The citizens shouted, ‘The voice of a god and not of a mortal!’
\v 23 And at once an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give the glory to God, and he became maggot-ridden and gave up the ghost.
\p
\v 24 But the word of God was growing and multiplying.
\p
\v 25 After completing their ministry, Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem bringing with them John, who was also called Mark.
\p
\c 13
\v 1 In the church at Antioch there were some who were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who is also called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a foster brother of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.
\v 2 They were worshipping the Lord and fasting when the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.’
\v 3 When they had fasted and prayed they laid hands on them and let them leave.
\p
\v 4 These men had truly been sent on their way by the Holy Spirit. They went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.
\v 5 Arriving at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues, and they had John to assist them.
\v 6 When they had passed right through the island to Paphos they found someone who was a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus.
\v 7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was a man of intelligence. He sent for Barnabas and Saul, wanting to hear the word of God,
\v 8 but Elymas the sorcerer, that is his name in translation, opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
\v 9 Saul, or Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, glared at him
\v 10 and said, ‘Full of all duplicity and everything malign, son of the devil, enemy of everything that is righteous, will you not stop twisting the straight ways of the Lord?
\v 11 Know that the Lord’s hand is now upon you. You will be blind; you will not see the sun for a time.’
\p Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he began wandering around, looking for someone to lead him by the hand.
\v 12 When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed. For he was astounded by the teaching of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Paul’s company set sail from Paphos and arrived at Perga in Pamphylia where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
\v 14 Then, travelling on from Perga, they reached Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.
\v 15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets the synagogue rulers sent to them, saying, ‘Men, brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, speak.’
\p
\v 16 Paul stood up, and with a movement of the hand he said, ‘Men, Israelites and those who fear God, listen.
\v 17 The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and raised up the people when they lived as exiles in the land of Egypt. Then with an uplifted arm he led them out from there,
\v 18 and over a period of about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness.
\v 19 Then when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided up the land among them.
\v 20 After that for about four hundred and fifty years he gave them judges, until Samuel the prophet.
\v 21 At that time they asked for a king, and for forty years God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 22 When he removed him he raised up for them David as king, of whom he testified, saying, “I have found in David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do all that I desire.”
\pi
\v 23 ‘From this man’s offspring God has brought salvation to Israel as he promised.
\v 24 Before his coming, John first preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel,
\v 25 and as John was finishing the course he said, “Who do you suppose I am? I am not he. No, but he is following me. I am not worthy to remove a sandal from his feet.”
\pi
\v 26 ‘Men, brothers, children of the stock of Abraham and those among you who fear God, to you this message of salvation has been sent.
\v 27 For those living in Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognise this man, and by condemning him they fulfilled the sayings of the prophets which are read each and every Sabbath.
\v 28 They found no reason at all why he should die, but they demanded that Pilate should put him to death.
\v 29 When they had fulfilled everything that had been written about him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead,
\v 31 and he was seen for many days by those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are his witnesses to the people.
\pi
\v 32 ‘We bring you the good news that the promise made to the ancestors has been kept, because God has accomplished this through the resurrection of Jesus for us, who are their children.
\v 33 For as it is written in the second Psalm, “You are my Son: today I have become your Father.”\rq Psalms 2:7\rq*
\v 34 That is why he has raised him from the dead with no possibility of returning to corruption, for this is what he has said: “I shall give you David’s true blessings.”\rq Isaiah 55:3\rq*
\v 35 And it is why he says elsewhere, “You will not allow your holy one to experience corruption.”\rq Psalms 15[16]:10\rq*
\v 36 Now when David in his own generation had served God’s purpose, he fell asleep and was laid beside his ancestors, and he experienced corruption;
\v 37 but the one whom God has raised up has not experienced corruption.
\pi
\v 38 ‘Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this man the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
\v 39 Because everyone who believes in this man is set free from everything in the law of Moses that prevents you from being righteous.
\v 40 Watch out then that what was spoken by the prophets may not come upon you:
\v 41 “Take heed, you who show contempt, and marvel, and perish. For I am doing a deed in your days, a deed which you will not believe even though someone should explain it to you.”’\rq Habakkuk 1:5\rq*
\p
\v 42 On leaving the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles begged them to speak to them about these matters on the next Sabbath.
\v 43 When the congregation had been dismissed many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke with them, urging them to continue in the grace of God.
\v 44 Then, on the next Sabbath, almost the entire city gathered to hear the word of God.
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the crowds they were filled with jealousy, and challenged what was being said by Paul, contradicting him and vilifying him.
\p
\v 46 Speaking with confidence, Paul and Barnabas said, ‘It was necessary that the word of God should be preached to you first, but since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, you see that we are turning to the Gentiles.
\v 47 For this is what the Lord has commanded us, “I have appointed you to be a light for the Gentiles: your purpose is salvation for the ends of the earth.”’\rq Isaiah 49:6\rq*
\p
\v 48 Hearing this, the Gentiles rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord; and all who were destined for life everlasting believed,
\v 49 and the word of the Lord word spread throughout the entire region.
\v 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout women of rank and the prominent men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their district.
\v 51 Shaking the dust from their feet against them, they went to Iconium.
\p
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
\p
\c 14
\v 1 At Iconium this happened. They went together into the synagogue of the Jews to speak, with the result that a very great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
\v 2 But the unbelieving Jews made trouble and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers,
\v 3 and so they remained there for quite some time, continuing to speak with boldness about the Lord who bore witness to the message of his grace, granting signs and wonders through their hands.
\v 4 But the city’s population was divided: some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
\v 5 When both the Gentiles and the Jews together with their rulers determined to use violence and to stone them,
\v 6 they found out and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, to Lystra and Derbe and the country round about,
\v 7 and they preached the Gospel there.
\p
\v 8 Now at Lystra there was a man with no strength in his feet. Being lame from his mother’s womb, he was sitting down; he had never walked.
\v 9 He listened to Paul who was speaking, and he, looking closely at the man and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
\v 10 said in a loud voice, ‘Stand upright on your feet.’ And he leapt up and began to walk.
\v 11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices in Lycaonian, declaring, ‘The gods have taken human form and have come down to us.’
\v 12 They called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, because he was the main speaker.
\v 13 The priest of Zeus whose temple\f +\fr 14:13\ft ‘temple’ is not in the Greek\f* is above their city brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and with the people he wanted to offer a sacrifice.
\v 14 When they heard about this, the apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, crying out
\v 15 and saying, ‘Men, why are you doing this? We are human beings just like you. We are proclaiming the Gospel to you, to turn from these useless things to the living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
\v 16 In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways,
\v 17 although he did not leave himself without witness: doing good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.’
\v 18 Even by saying this they could scarcely restrain the crowds from sacrificing to them.
\p
\v 19 Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, leaving him for dead.
\v 20 But when the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the city. And on the following day he left for Derbe with Barnabas.
\p
\v 21 When they had preached the Gospel to that city as well and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,
\v 22 strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to persevere in the faith, ‘Because it is through many tribulations that we must enter the Kingdom of God.’
\v 23 They appointed presbyters for them in every church, and having prayed with fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
\p
\v 24 Then passing through Pisidia they arrived in Pamphylia.
\v 25 They preached the word at Perga, went down to Attalia,
\v 26 and sailed from there to Antioch where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
\v 27 When they arrived they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
\v 28 They remained there with the disciples for some time.
\p
\c 15
\v 1 Then some men came down from Judaea. They were teaching the brothers, ‘Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.’
\v 2 When no small controversy and dispute arose between them and Paul and Barnabas regarding this question, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas and some others among them to go up to the Apostles and presbyters in Jerusalem.
\v 3 They were duly sent on their way by the church, and as they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria they were speaking about the conversion of the Gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers and sisters.
\v 4 When they reached Jerusalem they were received on behalf of the church by the Apostles and presbyters and they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 5 Some of the believers from the sect of the Pharisees objected, saying, ‘It is necessary to circumcise them and also to order them to keep the law of Moses.’
\v 6 And so the Apostles and the presbyters assembled to look into this matter.
\p
\v 7 After there had been much discussion, Peter stood up and said to them, ‘Men, brothers, you know that some time ago God decided for us that the Gentiles should hear the message of the Gospel from my mouth and believe.
\v 8 And God who knows the heart has testified on their behalf by giving the Holy Spirit to them also, just as he did to us.
\v 9 He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
\v 10 Why then are you now testing God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, one which neither our ancestors nor we have had the strength to bear?
\v 11 It is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we have faith to be saved, just as they have too.’
\p
\v 12 Then the whole company fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related the many signs and wonders that God had brought about through them among the Gentiles.
\p
\v 13 And when they fell silent, James responded, saying, ‘Men, brothers, listen to me.
\v 14 Simeon has spoken about how, at the beginning, God sought to take from among the nations a people for his name.
\v 15 This is consistent with the words of the prophets. As it is written,
\v 16 “Later I shall return and rebuild the Tent of David which has fallen, and I shall rebuild its ruins and set it right
\v 17 so that the rest of humanity may seek out the Lord, all the nations over whom my name has been invoked, says the Lord who is doing all these things.”\rq Amos 9:11-12, Septuagint reading.\rq*
\v 18 Everything he has done from ages past is known to God.
\v 19 My verdict, therefore, is not to trouble those of the Gentiles who are turning to God any further,
\v 20 but to write to them that they are to abstain from the defilement of idolatry, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.
\v 21 For in every town from generations long past Moses has had those who preach him, and he is read Sabbath by Sabbath in the synagogues.’
\p
\v 22 Then the Apostles and the presbyters with the whole church were minded to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas men chosen from among themselves: Judas, also called Barsabbas, and Silas: men of authority among the brothers and sisters.
\p
\v 23 By their hand they wrote,
\p ‘The Apostles, the presbyters and the brothers and sisters, to those at Antioch and in Syria and Cilicia, the brothers and sisters who are Gentiles, greetings.
\pi
\v 24 ‘When we heard that some who went out from us have been troubling you with arguments, unsettling your souls, saying that you must be circumcised and keep the law, although they had no such commission from us,
\v 25 we met and decided unanimously to choose men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\v 26 men who have surrendered their souls for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 27 Accordingly, we have sent Judas and Silas, and they will explain these things through the spoken word.
\v 28 For it seemed right to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no greater burden on you than what is necessary:
\v 29 to abstain from what is sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.
\pi ‘Keep yourselves from these things, and you will do well. Farewell.’
\p
\v 30 They were duly sent on their way and arrived at Antioch. They then gathered the community together and delivered the letter.
\v 31 When they read it they rejoiced on account of the reassurance.
\v 32 Judas, and Silas too, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers and sisters with many words.
\v 33 After staying for some time, they were sent on their way in peace by the brothers and sisters to the Apostles,
\v 34 but Silas thought it right to stay longer.
\v 35 Paul and Barnabas remained at Antioch, and with many others they taught and preached the Gospel, the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 36 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, ‘Let is return to visit our brothers and sisters in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they are.’
\v 37 Barnabas was determined to include John who is also called Mark,
\v 38 but Paul did not think it appropriate to take with them someone who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not kept company with them in the work.
\v 39 A dispute developed. So much so that they separated from one another. Barnabas took Mark and set sail for Cyprus,
\v 40 and Paul chose Silas and departed after being entrusted to the grace of God by the brothers and sisters.
\v 41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
\p
\c 16
\v 1 He reached Derbe and Lystra, and a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a faithful Jewish woman and of a Greek father.
\v 2 He was well spoken of by the brothers and sisters at Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 Paul wanted him to accompany him. He took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for everyone knew his father to be a Greek.
\v 4 As they made their way through the cities, they handed on to them the rules to be observed which had been decreed by the Apostles and presbyters in Jerusalem.
\v 5 The churches were therefore truly established in the faith and were increasing in number day by day.
\p
\v 6 They passed through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in Asia.
\v 7 They continued in the direction of Mysia and tried to go on to Bithynia, but the Spirit did not allow them,
\v 8 and passing through Mysia, they came down to Troas.
\v 9 During the night Paul received a vision. A man of Macedonia stood there, begging him and saying, ‘Come over to Macedonia and help us.’
\p
\v 10 After he had seen the vision we immediately determined to set out for Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel to them.
\v 11 We sailed from Troas and set a straight course for Samothrace, then on the following day to Neapolis,
\v 12 and from there to Philippi which is a principal city of the province of Macedonia, a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days.
\p
\v 13 On the Sabbath day, we went outside the city to a riverside, a usual place for prayer. We sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered.
\v 14 Listening was one particular woman named Lydia, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, a worshipper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay close attention to what was being said by Paul,
\v 15 and when she and her household had been baptised she begged us, saying, ‘If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my house.’ And she insisted.
\p
\v 16 As we were on our way to prayer a slave girl met us. She had a spirit of divination and provided a large profit for her masters by fortune-telling.
\v 17 Following Paul and Silas closely, she would shout out, ‘These men are servants of the Most High God. They are proclaiming the way of salvation to us.’
\v 18 And she did this for many days. Paul became exasperated, and turning around he said to the spirit, ‘I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.’ And it came out at that instant.
\p
\v 19 When her masters saw that their expectation of profit had gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them before the rulers in the marketplace.
\v 20 Bringing them to the magistrates, they said, ‘These men are greatly troubling our city. They are Jews,
\v 21 and they are preaching customs which are not lawful for us Romans to adopt or to practise.’
\v 22 The mob then rose together against them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothes and ordered that they be flogged.
\v 23 When they had beaten them with many blows they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely.
\v 24 On receiving such an order, he thrust them into the innermost cell and secured their feet in the stocks.
\p
\v 25 At about midnight Paul and Silas were praying, praising God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 Then suddenly there was a great earthquake which shook the foundations of the prison. In an instant all the doors were opened and everyone’s shackles released.
\v 27 The jailer, waking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew a sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
\v 28 But Paul shouted in a loud voice, saying, ‘Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.’
\p
\v 29 Calling for lights, he rushed in and fell down trembling in front of Paul and Silas.
\v 30 When he had brought them out he asked, ‘Masters, what must I do to be saved?’
\p
\v 31 They said, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, you and your household.’
\v 32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all those in his house.
\v 33 Then at that hour of the night he took them and bathed their wounds. He was baptised straight away, both he himself and all who were his.
\v 34 He then took them into his house, put food on the table, and began to celebrate with the whole family that he had come to faith in God.
\p
\v 35 When day came the magistrates sent officers to say, ‘Let those people go.’
\p
\v 36 The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, ‘The magistrates have sent word that you may be released. Therefore leave now. Go in peace.’
\p
\v 37 But Paul said to them, ‘Though we are Romans they have beaten us publicly without trial and have thrown us into prison, and now they are pushing us out quietly. No. Let them come themselves and lead us out.’
\p
\v 38 The officers reported these words to the magistrates, and on hearing that they were Romans they were afraid.
\v 39 They came and pleaded with them. Leading them out, they asked them to leave the city.
\v 40 When they left the prison they went to Lydia’s house, and on seeing the brothers and sisters they encouraged them. Then they departed.
\p
\c 17
\v 1 Passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
\v 2 As was Paul’s custom he joined them, and for three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
\v 3 explaining and demonstrating that, ‘The Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.’
\p
\v 4 Some of them were convinced and, together with a large number of devout Greeks and quite a few of the principal women, they threw in their lot with Paul and Silas.
\v 5 But the unbelieving Jews recruited some rogues off the streets, gathered a mob, and set the city in uproar. They besieged Jason’s house, wanting to haul them before the people.
\v 6 When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers in front of the magistrates, yelling, ‘These people have turned the world upside down and have come here as well.
\v 7 Jason has given them shelter. They all behave contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is a different king, Jesus.’
\v 8 The crowd and the magistrates were troubled when they heard this,
\v 9 but when they had taken security from Jason and the others they released them.
\v 10 The brothers and sisters immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Beroea during the night. When they arrived they went to the Jewish synagogue.
\p
\v 11 These people were more noble-minded than those at Thessalonica. They received the word very readily, and examined the Scriptures day after day for whether these things were so.
\v 12 Many of them did indeed believe: Greek women of high rank, and a good number of men.
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learnt that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Beroea as well, they went there too and incited the crowds.
\v 14 At once the brothers and sisters dispatched Paul to make his way to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy remained there.
\v 15 Those escorting Paul conducted him as far as Athens. Then, after receiving an instruction for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible, they departed.
\p
\v 16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens he was deeply distressed to observe that the city was wholly given over to idolatry.
\v 17 Consequently he began debating in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing, and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be there.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers would join him. Some were saying, ‘What does this prattler want to say?’ and others, ‘He seems to be a promoter of foreign deities,’ because he was proclaiming Jesus and the resurrection to them.
\p
\v 19 They took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying, ‘Is it possible for us to know what this new teaching is, of which you speak?
\v 20 You are bringing to our ears some strange things indeed, and we wish to learn the meaning of these things.’
\v 21 Now all Athenians and the foreigners living there devote their time to nothing except relating or listening to something new.
\p
\v 22 Paul stood at the centre of the Areopagus and spoke. ‘Men, Athenians, I perceive that in every respect you are more religious than others.
\v 23 As I came along, contemplating your objects of worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, “To an unknown God.” The one whom you worship in ignorance, I proclaim to you.
\v 24 The God who made the world and everything in it is Lord of heaven and of earth. He does not live in shrines built by hands,
\v 25 neither does he require anything provided by human hand. It is he who gives life and breath and everything to everyone.
\v 26 From one blood he has made every nation and people to live on the face of the whole earth, and he has assigned the appointed times and boundaries of their habitation.
\v 27 They are to seek the Lord so that in reaching out to him they may perhaps find him; though he is not far from each one of us,
\v 28 for in him we live and move and exist. As some of your poets have said, “We too are born of him.”
\v 29 Since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the Divinity is like gold or silver or stone engraved by human skill and design.
\v 30 God has overlooked the periods of ignorance, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent
\v 31 because he has set a Day on which he intends to judge the world with righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has given an assurance to all by raising him from the dead.’
\p
\v 32 When they heard of a resurrection from the dead, some scoffed, but others said, ‘We shall hear you again on this subject.’
\v 33 Paul went out from among them,
\v 34 and some joined him and believed, among them both Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
\p
\c 18
\v 1 After this Paul left Athens and arrived at Corinth
\v 2 where he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews out of Rome. He visited them,
\v 3 and since they were fellow craftsmen – they were tent-makers by trade – he stayed and worked with them.
\v 4 Every Sabbath he was in the synagogue, debating, and persuading both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was wholeheartedly taken up with testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
\v 6 But when they resisted and insulted him, he shook out his clothes and told them, ‘Your blood be upon your own heads; I am not responsible. From now on I shall go to the Gentiles,’
\v 7 and on leaving there he went to the house of someone called Justus, a God-fearer whose house adjoined the synagogue.
\v 8 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his entire household, and many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptised.
\p
\v 9 The Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, ‘Do not be afraid, but speak out; you are not to remain silent,
\v 10 for I am with you. No one will set upon you to do you mischief, for I have many people in this city.’
\v 11 And he stayed for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\p
\v 12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaea, the Jews made a concerted attack upon Paul and brought him before the tribunal,
\v 13 saying, ‘This man is persuading men and women to worship God contrary to the law.’
\v 14 As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, ‘If it were a matter of wrongdoing or some grievous crime, then certainly within reason I would bear with you Jews.
\v 15 But if it is a question of doctrine and definitions and of your own law, see to it yourselves for I have no desire to be a judge in these matters.’
\v 16 And he drove them from the court.
\v 17 Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the court, but Gallio did not care about any of that.
\p
\v 18 When Paul had stayed on for a number of days, he took his leave of the brothers and sisters and set sail for Syria. With him were Priscilla, and Aquila who had taken a vow and shaved his head at Cenchreae.
\v 19 He arrived at Ephesus and left them there, but he himself entered the synagogue and debated with the Jews.
\v 20 They begged him to stay with them longer, but he declined.
\v 21 Taking leave of them, he said, ‘Above all I must keep the coming feast in Jerusalem, but, God willing, I shall return to you again.’ Then he set sail from Ephesus.
\p
\v 22 On landing at Caesarea, he went up to greet the church and then travelled down to Antioch.
\v 23 When he had stayed for some time, he set out and methodically made his way through the province of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
\p
\v 24 A Jew named Apollos arrived at Ephesus. He was an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence and strong on the Scriptures.
\v 25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord and was on fire in the Spirit. Though he was speaking and teaching diligently about the Lord, he knew only the baptism of John.
\v 26 He began speaking confidently in the synagogue, and when Aquila and Priscilla heard about him, they took him aside and gave him a more accurate explanation of the Way of God.
\v 27 He was intending to travel on to Achaea, and the brothers and sisters wrote to the disciples, exhorting them to welcome him. When he arrived he did much to help those who through grace had believed,
\v 28 for he powerfully confounded the Jews in public, demonstrating through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
\p
\c 19
\v 1 While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul travelled overland to reach Ephesus. He found some disciples
\v 2 and asked them, ‘Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?’
\p They answered, ‘No. We had not even heard that there was a Holy Spirit.’
\p
\v 3 He asked them, ‘Into what then were you baptised?’
\p And they replied, ‘Into John’s baptism.’
\p
\v 4 Paul said, ‘John did indeed baptise with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who was coming after him, that is in Jesus Christ.’
\p
\v 5 On hearing this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus;
\v 6 and when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
\v 7 There were in all about twelve men.
\p
\v 8 He then went into the synagogue, and for three months he spoke openly, reasoning with them and persuading them of matters concerning the Kingdom of God.
\v 9 But when some became stubborn and disbelieving, reviling the Way in front of everyone, he abandoned them, separating out the disciples, and he held daily discussions in the school of a certain Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all who were living in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
\p
\v 11 God was also performing extraordinary miracles at the hands of Paul,
\v 12 to the extent that even face-towels or cloths that he had touched were taken to the sick, and the illnesses left them and the evil spirits were driven out of them.
\p
\v 13 Some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to name the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, ‘We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.’
\v 14 Now there were some, the seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
\v 15 But the evil spirit answered back, saying, ‘Jesus I know, and I know who Paul is, but who are you?’
\v 16 Then the man in whom the evil spirit was present leapt upon them and overpowered them with the result that, naked and wounded, they fled from that house.
\v 17 This became known to everyone living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being exalted.
\v 18 Many of those who believed were coming to acknowledge and confess their deeds,
\v 19 and quite a number of those who practised magic were bringing their books and publicly burning them. They calculated their value and found it was fifty thousand pieces of silver.
\v 20 In this way the word of the Lord was growing and prevailing.
\p
\v 21 When all this had been accomplished, Paul set his mind to travel through Macedonia and Achaea and on to Jerusalem, saying, ‘After I have been there I must also see Rome.’
\p
\v 22 Sending two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself stayed on for a while in Asia.
\v 23 There arose at that time no little disturbance concerning the Way
\v 24 because of a man called Demetrius, a silversmith who was making silver shrines of Artemis. This provided no small profit for the craftsmen.
\v 25 He convened a meeting and said to those employed in such work, ‘Men, you know that our wealth comes from this trade,
\v 26 yet you see and hear that not only at Ephesus but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has convinced and turned away a great number of people, saying that things made with hands are not gods.
\v 27 Not only is there a danger for us that this craft will fall into disrepute, but also that the Temple of the great goddess Artemis will be considered of no account, and that the glory of her whom all of Asia and the world revere is going to be destroyed.’
\p
\v 28 On hearing this, they were enraged and shouted, ‘Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.’
\v 29 Then the whole city was filled with confusion, and they all rushed together into the theatre, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus, the Macedonians who were Paul’s travelling companions.
\v 30 When Paul wanted to go in to the mob, the disciples would not let him;
\v 31 and some of the provincial officials\f +\fr 19:31 \ft ‘Asiarchs’ – high Roman officials in the province of Asia Minor.\f* who were his friends sent word to him, begging him not to show himself in the theatre.
\v 32 Some were shouting one thing and others another, for the assembly was in disorder and the majority did not know why they had gathered.
\v 33 From the crowd they thrust Alexander forward, and the Jews pushed him to the front. Alexander signalled with his hand, wishing to make a defence to the people,
\v 34 but when they realised that he was a Jew, they roared out in unison for about two hours, ‘Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.’
\p
\v 35 When the city’s Administrator had quelled the crowd he said, ‘Men of Ephesus, is there anyone who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the dedicated guardian of the great goddess Artemis, and of what fell from heaven?
\v 36 Since these things are irrefutable, you ought to remain silent and do nothing impetuously.
\v 37 But you have brought these men who are neither despoilers of the Temple nor blasphemers of your goddess.
\v 38 If, however, Demetrius and the craftsmen have a case against anyone, courts are convened and there are proconsuls. Let them lay charges against one another.
\v 39 And if you want something relating to other matters, it will be settled in lawful assembly.
\v 40 For we are in danger of being accused of insurrection concerning this day, because there is no reason that we can offer as an explanation for this unruly gathering.’
\v 41 After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.
\p
\c 20
\v 1 When the disturbance came to an end, Paul summoned the disciples, and after taking leave of them he set out to travel on into Macedonia.
\v 2 He made his way through those districts, encouraging them with many words, and arrived in Greece.
\v 3 He had been there for three months, and as he was about to start out for Syria, the Jews hatched a plot against him and he resolved to return through Macedonia.
\v 4 Accompanying him as far as Asia were Sopater of Beroea, the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
\v 5 They went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
\v 6 Then, following the Days of Unleavened Bread, we set sail from Philippi. In five days we reached them at Troas where we stayed for seven days.
\p
\v 7 On the first day of the week the disciples came together to break bread. Paul, intending to leave the following day, preached to them. He was still preaching at midnight.
\v 8 There were quite a few oil lamps in the upper room where we were meeting,
\v 9 and a young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window, sinking into a deep sleep. As Paul preached on and on, he was slumped in sleep and fell from the third floor and was taken up for dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down, fell upon on him and took him in his arms, saying, ‘Do not be dismayed, for his breath is in him.’
\p
\v 11 Going upstairs, he broke bread, and when he had eaten he engaged in conversation for quite some time, until daybreak, and then went on his way.
\v 12 They took the boy away alive, and were not a little comforted.
\p
\v 13 We had gone on ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, planning to take Paul on board there as he had arranged: he intended to make his own way on foot.
\v 14 When he met up with us at Assos we took him on board and went on to Mitylene.
\v 15 The following day we sailed on from there and arrived off Chios, and the day after we reached Samos. Then, having stayed at Trogyllium, we went on to Miletus.
\v 16 Paul decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not lose time in Asia, for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, by the Day of Pentecost.
\p
\v 17 And so from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, summoning the presbyters of the church.
\v 18 When they reached him, he said to them, ‘You yourselves know how I was with you the whole time, from the first day I set foot in Asia,
\v 19 serving the Lord with all humility and with many tears, and of the trials that came upon me from the plots of the Jews against me;
\v 20 how I held back nothing that was profitable by not revealing it to you, and I taught you in public and at home,
\v 21 testifying to both Jews and Greeks about repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
\pi
\v 22 ‘Now listen. I am bound by the Spirit to go on to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
\v 23 except that in every city the Holy Spirit testifies that chains and afflictions await me.
\v 24 But I take no account of any of these things, nor do I hold my life dear to myself as long as I may complete my race with joy, and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus to bear witness to the Gospel of God’s grace.
\pi
\v 25 ‘And now I know that none of you among whom I have travelled, preaching the Kingdom of God, will ever see my face again.
\v 26 This is why today I am calling you to witness that I bear no guilt for the blood of anyone at all,
\v 27 for I have not held back from proclaiming to you the whole counsel of God.
\v 28 Therefore be attentive to yourselves and to the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you bishops. Shepherd the Church of our Lord and God which he has purchased with his own blood,
\v 29 for I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, and they will not spare the flock.
\v 30 And from among yourselves men will arise who will preach perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.
\v 31 For this reason be vigilant, remembering that for three years, night and day, I have not ceased warning each of you with tears.
\v 32 And now, brothers, I commit you to God and to the word of his grace which has the power to build up and to give you an inheritance with all who are sanctified.
\pi
\v 33 ‘I coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands have provided for my needs and for those with me.
\v 35 I have revealed all this to you because it is necessary by labouring in this way to support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said it is more blessed to give than to receive.’
\p
\v 36 Having said this, he knelt down with them all and prayed.
\v 37 Then there was much weeping all round, and they fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him.
\v 38 Their greatest sorrow was that he had said that they would not see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
\p
\c 21
\v 1 We parted from them and sailed away, reaching Cos on a straight course, then the next day on to Rhodes, and from there to Patara
\v 2 where we found a ship bound for Phoenicia and embarked and set sail.
\v 3 Cyprus came into view; leaving it to port, we sailed on towards Syria and landed at Tyre, for the ship was to unload the cargo there.
\v 4 Discovering disciples, we stayed there for seven days, and through the Spirit they told Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 5 When the time drew to an end we left and went on our way. Everyone including the women and children escorted us until we were out of the city. Then we knelt on the shore and prayed.
\v 6 After embracing one another we boarded the ship, and they returned home.
\p
\v 7 Completing the voyage from Tyre, we reached Ptolemais, greeted the brothers and sisters, and spent one day with them.
\v 8 We left the following day, arrived at Caesarea, and went to the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven, and we lodged with him.
\v 9 This man had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
\v 10 We stayed on for a number of days, and a prophet named Agabus someone came down from Judaea.
\v 11 He approached us, took Paul’s belt, and bound his own feet and hands. He said, ‘The Holy Spirit is saying that this is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man whose belt this is, and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’
\p
\v 12 When we heard this, we and those who were there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 But Paul replied, ‘What are you doing, sobbing and breaking my heart? I am ready, not only to be in bonds, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.’
\p
\v 14 Since he was not to be persuaded, we let it rest, saying, ‘The Lord’s will be done.’
\p
\v 15 At the end of those days we packed up and started to make our way up to Jerusalem.
\v 16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us bringing with them an early disciple, a certain Mnason of Cyprus with whom we were to lodge.
\p
\v 17 When we arrived in Jerusalem the brothers and sisters welcomed us warmly.
\v 18 The following day Paul went with us to visit James, and all the presbyters were present.
\v 19 After he had greeted them he recounted one by one all the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry,
\v 20 and when they heard this, they gave glory to God. They also told him, ‘Understand, brother, that there are many thousands of Jews who have come to faith, and they are all zealous for the law.
\v 21 They have been told about you that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise the children nor to observe the customs.
\v 22 What are we to do? A huge congregation is certain to gather, for they will hear that you have arrived.
\v 23 Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.
\v 24 Join them, be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live by observing the law.
\v 25 But as for the Gentiles who believe, we have written and have given judgement that they are to observe none of this, but only to keep themselves from meat offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality.’
\p
\v 26 Then on the following day Paul accompanied the men. When he had purified himself with them, he went into the Temple to give notice of the period until the purification was complete, when an offering would be made on behalf of each one of them.
\v 27 But when the seven days were about to come to an end, Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple and started to rally the whole crowd. They hung on to him,
\v 28 shouting, ‘Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere in opposition to the people and to the law and to this place. He has even brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled this holy place.’
\v 29 This was because they had seen him in the city with Trophimus the Ephesian whom they supposed Paul had brought into the Temple.
\p
\v 30 The whole city was roused, and the people came running. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the Temple, and then the doors were quickly shut.
\v 31 As they were trying to kill him, a report went up to the commander of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in uproar.
\v 32 He immediately took soldiers and centurions and bore down upon them, and when they saw the commander and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul.
\v 33 The commander came up, arrested him, and gave orders for him to be bound with two chains. He then inquired who he was and what he had been doing.
\v 34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another. Because of the uproar he could not gain a clear understanding, and so he ordered Paul\f +\fr 21:34\ft ‘him’ in the Greek.\f* to be taken to the barracks,
\v 35 and on reaching the steps he was carried up by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.
\v 36 For the whole mob was following, shouting, ‘Take him away!’
\p
\v 37 As Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, ‘May I say something to you?’
\p He replied, ‘You know Greek?
\v 38 Then you are not the Egyptian who caused trouble some time ago and led the four thousand murderous outlaws into the desert?’
\p
\v 39 Paul replied, ‘I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city not without importance. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.’
\p
\v 40 He gave him permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, signalled to the people with his hand. When there was complete silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
\p
\c 22
\v 1 ‘Men, brothers and fathers, now listen to my defence to you.’
\p
\v 2 When they heard that he was speaking to them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even quieter. Then he said,
\v 3 ‘I am indeed a Jewish man. I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel. I have been instructed in the law of the ancestors in meticulous detail. I am zealous for God, as all of you are today.
\v 4 I persecuted this Way to the death. I arrested and committed to prison both men and women
\v 5 as the High Priest and the entire council of elders will testify for me, and from them I received letters for the brothers in Damascus. I then set out to bring to Jerusalem under arrest those there also so that they might be punished.
\pi
\v 6 ‘As I was travelling and approaching Damascus, suddenly at about midday a great light from heaven shone around me.
\v 7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”
\v 8 I answered, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said to me, “I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.”
\v 9 Although those who were with me saw the light and were terrified, they did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me.
\v 10 I asked, “What shall I do, Lord?” And the Lord said to me, “Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything that has been appointed for you to do.”
\v 11 And as I was unable to see because of the brilliance of that light, I arrived in Damascus led by the hand by those who were with me.
\pi
\v 12 ‘A certain man, Ananias, devout with respect to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews living in Damascus,
\v 13 came to me and stood there saying to me, “Brother Saul, look up!” And at that moment I saw him.
\v 14 Then he said, “The God of our ancestors has already chosen you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear the sound of his voice,
\v 15 for you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 And now, why delay? Arise, be baptised and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.”
\pi
\v 17 ‘When I returned to Jerusalem, while I was praying in the Temple this happened: I fell into a trance
\v 18 and I saw him saying to me, “Leave Jerusalem quickly; hurry, because they will not accept your testimony about me.”
\v 19 But I said, “Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you.
\v 20 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I too was present, assenting to his death and watching over the coats of those killing him.”
\v 21 Then he said to me, “Go, for I shall send you to distant nations.”’
\p
\v 22 Until he said that they had listened to him, but then they raised a shout, crying, ‘Rid the earth of his sort, for he is not fit to live.’
\v 23 They were howling and flinging off their coats and throwing dust into the air.
\p
\v 24 The commander said, ‘Let him be interrogated by scourging,’ and ordered him to be brought into the barracks so that he might discover for what crime they were yelling at him like that.
\p
\v 25 As they stretched him out with leather straps, Paul asked the centurion in attendance, ‘Is it lawful for you to flog without trial someone who is a Roman?’
\p
\v 26 On hearing this, the centurion approached the commander and reported, saying, ‘Be careful about what you are going to do because this man is a Roman.’
\p
\v 27 The commander came and asked him, ‘Tell me, are you a Roman?’
\p And he said, ‘Yes.’
\p
\v 28 The commander’s response was, ‘I bought this citizenship at great cost.’
\p And Paul replied, ‘But I was born so.’
\p
\v 29 Those who were about to interrogate him immediately left him, and the commander, knowing that he was a Roman, was also afraid because he had bound him.
\v 30 And so on the following day, intending to gain a clear understanding of what he was being accused by the Jews, he released him from the shackles and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to attend. He brought Paul down and set him before them.
\p
\c 23
\v 1 Paul looked directly at the Sanhedrin and said, ‘Men, brothers, to this day I have lived before God in all good conscience.’
\v 2 The High Priest Ananias ordered those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.
\v 3 Then Paul said to him, ‘God is about to strike you, you whitewashed wall, you who sit judging me under the law and yet in breach of the law you order me to be beaten.’
\p
\v 4 Those standing by said, ‘You are insulting God’s High Priest.’
\p
\v 5 And Paul said, ‘I did not know, brothers, that he was the High Priest, for it is written, “You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.”\rq Exodus 22:28\rq*’
\p
\v 6 Now when Paul realised that one element were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin, ‘Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. It is about hope and the resurrection of the dead, that I am being accused.’
\p
\v 7 When he said this an argument broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the assembly was divided,
\v 8 for while the Sadducees say there is no resurrection nor angels nor spirits, the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
\v 9 A great uproar ensued with the scribes of the Pharisees’ party standing up to do battle, declaring, ‘We find no evil in this man. If a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.’
\p
\v 10 The argument became so fierce that the commander, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, ordered the troops to go down and use force to remove him from among them and bring him into the barracks.
\p
\v 11 That night the Lord stood by him and said, ‘Courage, Paul. For as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must bear witness in the same way in Rome also.’
\p
\v 12 When day came some of the Jews made a pact. They put themselves on oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
\v 13 There were more than forty who took this oath of conspiracy.
\v 14 They approached the chief priests and the elders and said, ‘We have put ourselves under a ban with an oath to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
\v 15 You, with the Sanhedrin, are now to inform the commander that tomorrow he should bring him down to you as though you were going to inquire more closely into matters concerning him. Meanwhile we shall be ready to kill him before he arrives.’
\p
\v 16 But Paul’s sister’s son heard of the ambush. Going to the barracks, he went in and told Paul.
\v 17 Calling one of the centurions, Paul said, ‘Conduct this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.’
\p
\v 18 He took him and duly brought him before the commander, saying, ‘The prisoner Paul summoned me, and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you.’
\p
\v 19 The commander took him by the hand and, withdrawing in private, he enquired, ‘What is it that you have to tell me?’
\p
\v 20 He replied, ‘The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly into something concerning him.
\v 21 But you should not accede to their request because lying in wait for him are more than forty men who have put themselves under oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are already prepared, waiting for your agreement.’
\p
\v 22 The commander then let the young man go, instructing him, “Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.”
\p
\v 23 Summoning two of the centurions, he said, ‘Make ready two hundred soldiers to set out for Caesarea at the third hour of the night with seventy cavalry and two hundred spearmen.
\v 24 Also provide mounts for Paul to convey him in safety to Felix the governor.’
\p
\v 25 He wrote a letter in this style:
\p
\v 26 Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix.
\p Greeting!
\p
\v 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. I arrived with troops, and on rescuing him I learnt that he was a Roman.
\v 28 Wanting to know of what crime they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin.
\v 29 I found him to be accused with respect to questions of their law, but they made no accusation justifying death or imprisonment.
\v 30 When an imminent ambush by the Jews against the man was disclosed to me, I immediately despatched him to you. I have also instructed the accusers to lay before you what there is against him.
\p Farewell.
\p
\v 31 Then as they had been directed, the soldiers took Paul and carried him through the night to Antipatris.
\v 32 On the following day they allowed the cavalry to remain with him while they returned to barracks.
\p
\v 33 When they entered Caesarea they presented Paul to the governor and delivered the letter to him.
\v 34 After reading it he enquired what province he was from, and learnt that he was from Cilicia.
\v 35 ‘I shall hear from you,’ he declared, ‘when your accusers have also arrived.’ And he ordered him to be held in Herod’s praetorium.
\p
\c 24
\v 1 Five days later, Ananias the High Priest came down with the elders and a advocate, one Tertullus, and they revealed to the governor what they had against Paul.
\v 2 On being called, Tertullus began the prosecution by saying,
\v 3 ‘We enjoy great peace because of you, and good administration through your provident care for this nation. Always and everywhere we welcome this, Most Excellent Felix, with great gratitude.
\v 4 In order that I should not detain you at length, I entreat you of your goodness to listen to us briefly,
\v 5 for we have found this man to be a pestilence and an instigator of insurrection among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
\v 6 He also attempted to desecrate the Temple, but we arrested him, intending to prosecute him in accordance with our law.
\v 7 However Lysias, the commander, arrived in force and took him out of our hands.
\v 8 He ordered his accusers to appear before you. When you have questioned him yourself you will be able to comprehend all these things with which we charge him.’
\v 9 The Jews concurred, affirming these things to be so.
\p
\v 10 When the governor inclined his head for him to speak, Paul made his response. ‘Knowing that for many years you have been judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my own defence.
\v 11 You can be assured that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,
\v 12 and not in the Temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city have they found me arguing with anyone or inciting a mob;
\v 13 nor are they able to substantiate the charges they are now bringing against me.
\v 14 But I do admit this to you, that I worship the God of our ancestors according to the Way, which they call a sect, believing everything that is written in the law and the prophets.
\v 15 I have a hope in God which they themselves accept, that there is to be a resurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the unrighteous,
\v 16 and because of this I strive in every way to have a clear conscience before God and the people.
\pi
\v 17 ‘After many years I returned to give alms and to make offerings to my nation,
\v 18 and this is how some Jews from Asia found me in the Temple, ritually purified, with no mob nor with any disorder.
\v 19 They ought to be here before you to bring charges if they have anything against me.
\v 20 Otherwise let these men say whether, when I appeared before the Sanhedrin, they found any wrongdoing in me
\v 21 except for this one statement I voiced aloud when I stood before them, “It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged by you today.”’
\p
\v 22 When he had listened to this, Felix, who had quite an accurate understanding of the Way, adjourned them by saying, ‘When the commander Lysias comes down I shall know more about you.’
\v 23 He directed the centurion to detain Paul, but with some liberty, and not to forbid his own people from serving or visiting him.
\p
\v 24 A few days later Felix appeared with his wife Drusilla, a Jew. He sent for Paul and listened to him on the subject of faith in Christ.
\v 25 As he spoke about righteousness and self-control and the judgement to come, Felix became afraid and said, ‘Leave now. When I have an opportunity I shall send for you.’
\v 26 At the same time he was also hoping that he would be offered money by Paul to release him. This is also why he would send for him so often and converse with him.
\v 27 Then, when two years had elapsed, Felix had a successor: Porcius Festus. Wanting to bestow a favour upon the Jews, Felix left Paul in custody.
\p
\c 25
\v 1 Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
\v 2 The High Priest and the leaders of the Jews informed him about Paul and petitioned him,
\v 3 asking a favour against Paul\f +\fr 25:3\ft The Greek is ‘him’.\f*, that he should summon him to Jerusalem. They were arranging an ambush to kill him on the way.
\v 4 But Festus asserted that Paul would be detained at Caesarea, and that he himself was returning there soon.
\v 5 ‘Therefore those of you who are able should come down with me,’ he said, ‘and if there is anything against this man, let them state their case against him.’
\p
\v 6 After remaining with them for more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. On the following day, sitting in judgement, he ordered that Paul be brought.
\v 7 When he appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. After they had brought against Paul many weighty charges which they were not able to substantiate,
\v 8 Paul\f +\fr 25:8\ft The Greek is ‘he’.\f* said in his defence, ‘Not with respect to the Jewish law, nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar have I transgressed in any way.’
\p
\v 9 Then Festus, who wanted to grant the Jews a favour, said in response to Paul, ‘Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be judged by me concerning these matters?’
\p
\v 10 But Paul replied, ‘I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal where I should be tried. I have done the Jews no wrong, as you very well know.
\v 11 If I have indeed offended and done something deserving death, I am not unwilling to die. But if there is nothing in any of the things of which they accuse me, then no one can use me as a favour to them. I appeal to Caesar.’
\p
\v 12 At this, after conferring with the Council, Festus pronounced, ‘To Caesar you have appealed. To Caesar you shall go.’
\p
\v 13 A number of days later King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea and were welcomed by Festus.
\v 14 Since they were staying there for several days, Festus put the matter of Paul to the king, saying, ‘There is a certain man, a prisoner left by Felix,
\v 15 against whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid information. They demanded a conviction against him.
\v 16 I told them that it is not the custom of the Romans to grant a favour by condemning someone before the accused has faced the accusers and been offered the opportunity of making a defence in relation to the charge.
\v 17 Since they were all together, I did not delay. The very next day I took my place on the seat of judgement and commanded that the man be brought.
\v 18 The plaintiffs rose and laid against him none of the charges which I had imagined.
\v 19 They had instead some questions about him regarding their own religion, and about a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul insisted was alive.
\v 20 I was at a loss concerning this inquiry, and asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and to be tried there on these matters.
\v 21 But Paul appealed to be held for the decision of Augustus. I therefore ordered him to be detained until I sent him to Caesar.’
\p
\v 22 Agrippa said to Festus, ‘I too should like to hear this man.’
\p He replied, ‘Tomorrow you will hear him.’
\p
\v 23 On the following day when Agrippa and Bernice had appeared with great ceremony and had entered the audience-chamber with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, Festus gave the order and Paul was brought in.
\v 24 Then Festus spoke. ‘King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man. The entire Jewish population both in Jerusalem and here have petitioned me about him, protesting that he should no longer live.
\v 25 But I found that he had committed nothing deserving death, and when he himself appealed to the emperor I decided to send him.
\v 26 I have nothing of substance to write to the sovereign about him, which is why I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that when the investigation is concluded I may have something to write.
\v 27 For it seems to me unreasonable to dispatch a prisoner without also indicating the charges against him.’
\p
\c 26
\v 1 Agrippa said to Paul, ‘You may speak for yourself.’
\p Then Paul spread out his hands and began to make his defence.
\v 2 ‘Regarding everything of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself blessed, King Agrippa, that today I am about to make my defence before you,
\v 3 and above all because you are an authority on both the customs and controversies of the Jews. I beg you therefore to listen to me with patience.
\pi
\v 4 ‘All the Jews know of my way of life, even from youth, which, from the first, was among my people in Jerusalem.
\v 5 Knowing me from of old, they could testify, if they were willing, that I have lived as a Pharisee in accordance with the strictest sect of our religion.
\v 6 And I now stand accused on account of a hope, concerning a promise made by God to the ancestors,
\v 7 which our twelve tribes, zealously worshipping night and day, hope to attain. It is on account of this hope, King Agrippa, that I am being accused by the Jews.
\v 8 Why is it considered incredible to you all that God raises the dead?
\pi
\v 9 ‘Even so, I myself used to think that I ought to act strongly against the name of Jesus of Nazareth,
\v 10 which I did in Jerusalem, imprisoning many of the saints, having received authority from the chief priests. When they were being put to death I cast my vote against them;
\v 11 and in every synagogue I was constantly punishing them, forcing them to blaspheme, raging fanatically against them. I would pursue them even to foreign cities.
\pi
\v 12 ‘While doing this, I was travelling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests.
\v 13 At midday I was on the road, Your Majesty, when I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those travelling with me.
\v 14 We all fell to the ground. I heard a voice speaking to me, saying in the Hebrew language, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.”
\pi
\v 15 ‘I asked, “Who are you, Lord?”
\pi ‘And he replied, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
\v 16 But rise and stand on your feet, for this is why I have appeared to you, to appoint you as a servant and a witness both of what you have seen and of what I shall show you.
\v 17 I am choosing you from among the people, and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you
\v 18 to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, from the jurisdiction of Satan to God, and receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in me.”
\pi
\v 19 ‘From that moment, King Agrippa, I have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but to those in Damascus first, then to those in Jerusalem and the whole territory of Judaea and to the Gentiles, I have been proclaiming a call to repent, and to turn back to God by performing deeds appropriate for repentance.
\v 21 This is why the Jews seized me in the Temple and were trying to kill me.
\pi
\v 22 ‘I have enjoyed God’s help right up to this day, and I have continued to bear witness to small and great alike, saying nothing other than what both the prophets and Moses said would happen:
\v 23 that the Christ was to suffer, and how by first rising from the dead he would proclaim light, both to the people and to the Gentiles.’
\p
\v 24 As he was making this defence, Festus protested loudly, ‘Paul, you are raving. Too much learning is turning your mind.’
\p
\v 25 He maintained, ‘I am not raving, Most Excellent Festus, but speaking plainly about matters of truth and good sense.
\v 26 Indeed, the king, before whom I speak with confidence, is aware of these things; I am convinced that none of this is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.
\v 27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe!’
\p
\v 28 Agrippa said to Paul, ‘Before long you will persuade me to become a Christian.’
\p
\v 29 And Paul replied, ‘I wish to God that, whether in a little while or in the long term, not only you, but all of those who are listening to me this day may also become as I am, except for these chains.’
\p
\v 30 When he had said this, the king rose with the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.
\v 31 Having withdrawn, they were talking to one another, saying, ‘This man has done nothing deserving death or imprisonment.’
\v 32 Agrippa said to Festus, ‘This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.’
\p
\c 27
\v 1 When it had been decided that we should set sail for Italy, they committed Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan Cohort.
\v 2 Embarking on a ship from Adramyttium about to sail by the coasts of Asia, we put to sea. With us was Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
\v 3 The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul with courtesy, permitting him to go to friends to obtain hospitality.
\v 4 Setting out from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
\v 5 Sailing in deep water off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
\v 6 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria bound for Italy and put us on board.
\v 7 After several days, sailing slowly and with difficulty, we arrived off Cnidus. With the wind preventing us from making further headway, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone,
\v 8 and after passing it with difficulty we arrived at a place called Fair Havens, which is near the town of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 So much time had elapsed that sailing was now dangerous, for even the Fast\f +\fr 27:9\ft That is, the fast for the Day of Atonement.\f* was already over. Paul offered advice,
\v 10 saying to them, ‘Men, I see that the voyage is going to be disastrous with great loss, not only of cargo and the ship but also of our lives.’
\v 11 But the centurion was won over by the master and the shipowner rather than by what Paul was saying.
\v 12 Since the harbour was ill-suited for overwintering, the majority advised sailing on from there so that they might be able to overwinter when they had by some means reached Phoenix, a harbour in Crete which looks to the south-west and to the north-west.
\p
\v 13 With a gentle southerly wind blowing, they supposed that they had obtained their objective. They weighed anchor and set their course close by Crete,
\v 14 though not long afterwards a storm-force wind called the Levanter\f + \fr 27.14\ft The Greek ‘Euroclydon’, a northeaster.\f* struck her.
\v 15 The ship was caught up, and not being able to face into the wind we gave her up and were carried away.
\v 16 Running into the lee of a certain small island called Clauda, we were barely able to get control of the ship’s tender.
\v 17 They launched it and deployed cables to undergird the ship, fearing that they might be driven on to the shoals of Syrtis. With the sail reefed, we were carried along in that manner.
\v 18 We were being violently storm-tossed, and the following day they began throwing out the cargo;
\v 19 then on the third day with our own hands we flung the ship’s tackle overboard.
\v 20 With neither sun nor stars appearing over many days, and with no small storm beating upon us, from then on all hope of our being saved was gone,
\v 21 and for a long while we went without food.
\p Then Paul stood up among them and said, ‘Men, you really should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete, and so avoided this disaster and loss.
\v 22 But now, I beg you, be cheerful because there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\v 23 For last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I worship stood beside me.
\v 24 He said, “Do not be afraid, Paul, for you are to stand before Caesar. And know that God has granted to you all those sailing with you.”
\v 25 Therefore be of good cheer, men, because I believe God, that it will be just as I have been told.
\v 26 We shall have to be cast up on some island.’
\p
\v 27 When the fourteenth night came we were being tossed around in the Adriatic, and at about midnight the sailors suspected that they were approaching land.
\v 28 They took a sounding and got twenty fathoms\f + \fr 27.28\ft A fathom is 6 feet, or approximately 1.8 metres.\f*. A short while later they swung the lead again and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 In fear that we should run aground on reefs they let out four anchors from the stern, praying for day to dawn.
\v 30 The sailors wanted to abandon ship and lowered the ship’s tender into the sea, pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow.
\v 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, ‘Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.’
\v 32 And the soldiers cut the tender’s lines, letting it fall.
\p
\v 33 Then until day was about to dawn Paul urged everyone to eat, saying, ‘For fourteen days, waiting for this day, you have continued to fast and have eaten nothing.
\v 34 Therefore I beg you to take some nourishment. This is for your safety, for not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.’
\v 35 Saying this, he took bread, gave thanks to God in the sight of everyone, broke it, and began to eat.
\v 36 Then everyone became cheerful, and they themselves had something to eat.
\v 37 On the ship we were two hundred and seventy-six souls in all.
\v 38 Having eaten their fill, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard into the sea.
\p
\v 39 When day came they did not recognise the land, but they observed one particular cove with a beach. Into this they determined to drive the ship, if they could.
\v 40 Then they let go the anchors and abandoned them in the sea. At the same time they unlashed the tiller, hoisted the mainsail to the wind, and made for the shore.
\v 41 But they fell foul of an area of cross-currents and ran the vessel aground. The prow stuck fast and remained immovable, while the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.
\p
\v 42 The soldiers were of the opinion that they should kill the prisoners so that no one should escape by swimming away,
\v 43 but the centurion, wanting to save Paul, prevented them from doing this. He ordered those able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get ashore;
\v 44 then the rest: some on planks, some on items from the ship. And so it was that they all reached the shore safely.
\p
\c 28
\v 1 Once they were safe they learnt that the island was called Malta.
\v 2 The natives showed us no little kindness, for they welcomed us all and kindled a fire because of the continuing rain and because of the cold.
\v 3 As Paul was gathering up a bundle of dry sticks to put on the fire, a viper emerged due to the heat and clung to his hand.
\v 4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, ‘Surely this man is a murderer. He escaped from the sea but Justice has not allowed him to live.’
\v 5 He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and felt no ill-effects.
\v 6 They were expecting him to swell up at any moment or suddenly drop dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing strange happening to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
\p
\v 7 Now near that place were the grounds of the principal man of the island whose name was Publius. He welcomed us, and courteously put us up for three days.
\v 8 Publius’s father happened to be laid up, afflicted with fever and dysentery. Paul went in and prayed; he laid hands on him and healed him.
\v 9 When this was done, others in the island who had diseases also came, and they were healed.
\v 10 They honoured us in many ways, and on our departure they provided what was needed.
\p
\v 11 Three months later we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had overwintered in the island. Its figurehead was The Sons of Zeus\f + \fr 28.11\ft The Greek Dioscuri, the twin sons of Zeus, i.e. Castor and Pollux.\f*.
\v 12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed for three days.
\v 13 From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. One day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we reached Puteoli
\v 14 where we found brothers and sisters and were invited to stay with them for seven days. Then we went on to Rome.
\v 15 From there, hearing of us, the brothers came out to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he gave thanks to God and received encouragement.
\v 16 When we reached Rome the centurion handed over the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with a soldier guarding him.
\p
\v 17 Three days later Paul called together those who were prominent among the Jews. When they had assembled he said to them, ‘Men, brothers, I, who have done nothing against the people or the customs of the ancestors, am a prisoner from Jerusalem, betrayed into the hands of the Romans.
\v 18 After questioning me, they wanted to release me because there was no reason for me to die.
\v 19 But when the Jews objected I was forced to appeal to Caesar, although I had no accusation to make against my nation.
\v 20 It is for this reason that I asked to see you and to speak, for it is because of the hope of Israel that I am shackled with this chain.’
\p
\v 21 They told him, ‘We have received no letters from Judaea concerning you, nor has any brother arrived reporting or mentioning anything discreditable about you.
\v 22 We think it is worth hearing from you what your understanding is, because we are aware that everywhere this sect is spoken against.’
\p
\v 23 They set the day with him and began arriving at his lodgings, a great number of them. From dawn until dusk he expounded both from the Law of Moses and from the prophets, testifying earnestly about the Kingdom of God and convincing them of things relating to Jesus.
\v 24 Now some believed what was said, but others did not.
\v 25 In disagreement with one another, they began to leave.
\p Paul said one thing more: ‘How well the Holy Spirit spoke through Isaiah the prophet to our ancestors,
\v 26 telling them to go to this people and to say, “You will listen to what you are hearing but never understand; you will look at what you are seeing but never perceive.
\v 27 For the heart of this people has grown fat and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes for fear they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and turn so that I might heal them.”\rq Isaiah 6:9-10\rq*
\v 28 You should know then that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.’
\v 29 When he had said this the Jews left, arguing fiercely among themselves.
\p
\v 30 Paul remained for two whole years in his own rented accommodation, and he received all who came to him.
\v 31 He preached the Kingdom of God and taught about matters relating to the Lord Jesus Christ with total confidence and unhindered.
