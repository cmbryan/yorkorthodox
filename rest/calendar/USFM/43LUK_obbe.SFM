\v 1 Since many have tried their hand at setting out a narrative of what took place among us
\v 2 – exactly as those who were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word from the start have committed it to us –
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, after acquiring an accurate knowledge of everything from the beginning, to write an ordered account for you, most noble Theophilus,
\v 4 so that you might have a well-grounded understanding about what you have learnt.
\p
\v 5 In the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias of the ministry division of Abijah, and the name of his wife, a daughter of Aaron, was Elisabeth.
\v 6 They were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
\v 7 But they had no child because Elisabeth was barren, and both were well on in years.
\v 8 Now, it happened that as he was performing his priestly duties before God according to his division’s roster,
\v 9 it was his duty in the manner of the priesthood to enter the sanctuary of the Lord to burn incense.
\v 10 And at the hour of the incense offering a great throng of people was praying outside.
\p
\v 11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense,
\v 12 and Zacharias, seeing [him], was troubled and became fearful.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your prayer has been heard and your wife Elisabeth will bear a son for you, and you shall name him John.
\v 14 You shall have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth,
\v 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb,
\v 16 and he will turn many of the children of Israel back to the Lord their God.
\v 17 He will go on ahead in his presence, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to build up a people prepared for the Lord.”
\p
\v 18 And Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? – for I am an old man and my wife is well on in years.”
\p
\v 19 The angel answered, telling him, “I am Gabriel who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
\v 20 Now, listen! You will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled at their proper time.”
\p
\v 21 Now, the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised that he was lingering in the sanctuary.
\v 22 But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they realised that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was making signs to them but he remained mute.
\p
\v 23 When the time of his priestly duty was complete he returned home,
\v 24 and during those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and she hid herself for five months saying,
\v 25 “The Lord has done this for me at the time he looked upon me, to take away my disgrace among the people.”
\p
\v 26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.
\v 28 Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, highly favoured one; the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women.”
\p
\v 29 When she saw him she was alarmed by the words and wondered what sort of greeting this might be.
\v 30 But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.
\v 31 And, see! – you will conceive in the womb and bear a son; and you shall call his name Jesus.
\v 32 He will be great and will be called ‘Son of the Most High’, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
\v 33 He will reign over the house of Jacob into the ages, and of his Kingdom there shall be no end.”
\p
\v 34 Mary said to the angel, “How will this be possible for me since I am not intimate with a man?”
\p
\v 35 Answering, the angel told her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, the Holy One to be born shall be called ‘Son of God’.
\v 36 And, see! – your relative Elisabeth has herself conceived a son in her old age – and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren –
\v 37 because nothing at all is impossible with God.”
\p
\v 38 Mary said, “Look! The maidservant of the Lord; let it be to me as you have spoken.”
\p And the angel left her.
\p
\v 39 In those days Mary arose and set out, hurrying to the hill country, to a city of Judah.
\v 40 She entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elisabeth.
\v 41 What happened when Elisabeth heard Mary’s greeting was that the baby leapt in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
\v 42 Then she called out in a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women! And blessed is the fruit of your womb!
\v 43 Why is this [happening] to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For, you see, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears the baby in my womb leapt for joy.
\v 45 And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what had been said to her from the Lord.”
\p
\v 46 And Mary said,
\q1 “My soul magnifies the Lord
\q1
\v 47 and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour,
\q1
\v 48 for he has looked on the lowly status of his maid-servant.
\q1 And, see! – from now on all generations shall call me blessed
\q1
\v 49 because he who is mighty has done great things for me,
\q1 and Holy is his name.
\q1
\v 50 And his mercy is for generations of generations
\q1 upon those who fear him.
\q1
\v 51 He has done a mighty deed with his arm.
\q1 He has scattered the proud in the imaginations of their hearts.
\q1
\v 52 He has thrown down the powerful from their thrones
\q1 and lifted high the lowly.
\q1
\v 53 The hungry he has filled with good things,
\q1 but the rich he has sent away empty.
\q1
\v 54 He has helped his servant Israel
\q1 to be mindful of mercy
\q1
\v 55 when he spoke to our ancestors,
\q1 to Abraham and his offspring down the ages.”
\m
\v 56 Mary stayed with her for about three months, then returned home.
\p
\v 57 Then came the time for Elisabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
\v 58 The neighbours and her relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they congratulated her.
\v 59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were for naming him Zacharias, after his father.
\v 60 But his mother spoke up and told them, “Not so! He shall be called John.”
\p
\v 61 Then they said to her, “But no one in your family is called by that name.”
\v 62 And they started making signs to his father, [to find out] what he wanted him to be called;
\v 63 and having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, “His name is John.”
\p And they were all astonished.
\v 64 Suddenly his mouth was opened and his tongue [released], and he began speaking, praising God.
\v 65 Then fear fell upon all their neighbours, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about the subject,
\v 66 and everyone who heard about these things took them to heart, saying, “So who will this child become?” And the hand of the Lord was with him.
\p
\v 67 Then his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,
\q1 for he has visited and ransomed his people.
\q1
\v 69 And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us
\q1 in the house of his servant David,
\q1
\v 70 just as he stated through the mouths of his holy prophets from of old –
\q1
\v 71 to save [us] from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy to our ancestors, to remember his holy covenant,
\q1
\v 73 the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,
\q1 to grant us
\v 74 deliverance from the hand of our enemies,
\q1 worshiping him
\v 75 in holiness and righteousness in his presence all the days of our life.
\q1
\v 76 And you, child, shall be called ‘Prophet of the Most High’,
\q1 for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his paths,
\q1
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins
\q1
\v 78 through the tender mercies of our God;
\q1 because of which the Dawn from on high has visited us
\q1
\v 79 to give light to those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death,
\q1 to guide our feet onto the path of peace.”
\m
\v 80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the deserts until the day of his revealing to Israel.
\p
\c 2
\v 1 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the entire world should be enrolled.
\v 2 This was the first census, Cyrenius being governor of Syria.
\v 3 Everyone went to register in their own city.
\v 4 And so Joseph went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 
\v 5 to register himself with Mary, his betrothed, who was pregnant.
\p
\v 6 It happened while they were there that the time came for her to give birth.
\v 7 She gave birth to a son, her firstborn; and she swathed him and laid him in the manger – because there was no place for them in the inn.
\v 8 Now there were shepherds in the same area, encamped in the pastures and guarding their flock by night.
\v 9 Then, look! – an angel of the Lord stands before them and the glory of the Lord shines around them; and they are awestruck with great fear.
\v 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for, listen! – I am bringing you good news of great joy which will be for all people.
\v 11 For today, in the city of David, there was born for you a Saviour who is Christ the Lord,
\v 12 and this is your proof: you will find a baby, swathed, lying in a manger.”
\v 13 Suddenly, there was with the angel a great company of the Host of Heaven praising God, and saying,
\q1 
\v 14 ‘Glory to God on high! And on earth, peace, good will among the people.’
\m
\v 15 Then, when the angels had gone from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, “Yes, let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”
\v 16 So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and also the baby, lying in the manger.
\v 17 Taking it in, they revealed what had been said to them about the child,
\v 18 and all who heard were amazed by what was said to them by the shepherds.
\v 19 And Mary was remembering all this, pondering it in her heart.
\p
\v 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told them.
\p
\v 21 When the eighth day arrived, for the child to be circumcised, he was named Jesus, having been called that by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\p
\v 22 Then, when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were complete, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
\v 23 – as it is written in the law of the Lord, ‘Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord’\rq Exodus 13:2,12\rq*  –
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice in accordance with what is stated in the law of the Lord, ‘A brace of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.’\rq Leviticus 12:8\rq*
\v 25 Now, look, there was in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon, and this righteous and devout man was waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
\v 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had looked upon the Lord’s Anointed.
\v 27 He came in the Spirit into the temple when the parents were bringing in the child Jesus to fulfil on his behalf the custom of the law.
\v 28 Then he took him in his arms and blessed God, saying,
\q1
\v 29 “Now, Master, you are letting your servant depart in peace 
\q1 according to your word,
\q1
\v 30 for my eyes have seen your salvation
\q1
\v 31 which you have prepared before the face of all peoples
\q1
\v 32 – a light to enlighten the Gentiles
\q1 and the glory of your people Israel.”
\m
\v 33 Both Joseph and [the child’s] mother were amazed by what was spoken about him.
\v 34 Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, “Look! This [child] is set apart for the downfall and the rising again of many in Israel, and as a sign to be disputed
\v 35 – and a sword shall go right through your own soul as well – so that the thoughts of many hearts might be revealed.”
\p
\v 36 Then there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher, who was of a great age. After living with [her] husband for seven years from her virginity,
\v 37 she had been a widow for about eighty-four years. She did not leave the temple, worshipping with fasting and praying night and day.
\v 38 She was there at that time giving thanks to the Lord and speaking about him to all who were patiently waiting for redemption in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 39 Then, when they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.
\v 40 The child grew and and was strengthened in spirit, full of wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
\p
\v 41 Now, each year his parents made the journey to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover,
\v 42 and when he was twelve years old, according to custom, they went up to Jerusalem for the feast.
\v 43 The days passed, and on their return the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but Joseph and his mother did not notice.
\v 44 Supposing him to be in the company they went a day’s journey, then began looking for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
\v 45 When they did not find him they turned back to Jerusalem, looking for him.
\v 46 It was three days later that they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
\v 47 All who heard him were astonished by his knowledge and answers.
\v 48 Seeing him, they were amazed, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you done this to us? See, your father and I have been anxiously looking for you.”
\p
\v 49 But he said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not realise that I had to be about my Father’s business?”
\v 50 But they did not understand what he said to them.
\v 51 Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth; and he was obedient to them. All these sayings his mother kept faithfully in her heart.
\v 52 And Jesus was growing in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and the people.
\p

\v 1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod, tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip, tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region Trachonitis, and Lysanias, tetrarch of Abilene,
\v 2 Annas and Caiaphas being High Priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the desert
\v 3 and he went into all the countryside surrounding the Jordan preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet which says,
\q1 ‘The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
\q1 “Prepare the highway of the Lord!
\q1 Make his paths even!
\q1
\v 5 Every valley shall be filled up;
\q1 every mountain and hill shall be levelled down;
\q1 the bends shall be straightened;
\q1 and the rocky [places] shall become smooth roads.
\q1
\v 6 All humanity shall see the salvation of God.”’\rq Isaiah 40:3-5\rq*
\m
\v 7 To the crowds who went out to be baptised by him he said, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Now then, produce fruits worthy of repentance. Do not even begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have a father – Abraham’ for I tell you that God is able  from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
\v 9 And already the axe is in place against the base of the tree, and every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown on the fire.
\p
\v 10 Then the crowds asked him, “What, then, should we do?”
\p
\v 11 and in answer he told them, “Whoever has two coats should give to the one who has none; and whoever has food should do likewise.”
\p
\v 12 Even tax collectors came to be baptised, and they asked him, “Teacher, what shall we do?”
\p
\v 13 He told them, “Collect no more than is due to you.”
\p
\v 14 Soldiers, too, were questioning him, saying, “And we, what shall we do?”
\p and to them he said, “Bring false accusations against no one, intimidate no one and be content with your wages.”
\p
\v 15 The people were expectant, and they were speculating in their hearts about John, whether perhaps he might be the Christ.
\v 16 John responded, telling them all, “I do indeed baptise you with water, but there is one to come who is more powerful than me. I am not worthy to undo the strap of his sandals. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
\v 17 His winnowing-fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. Then he will gather the wheat into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”
\p
\v 18 And indeed, with many other exhortations he would preach the Gospel to the people.
\p
\v 19 Herod the tetrarch, having been censured by [John] over Herodias, his brother’s wife – and for all the evils which he, Herod, had committed –
\v 20 added even this to them all, that he incarcerated John in prison.
\p
\v 21 Now it happened while all the people were being baptised, that Jesus was also baptised; and as he prayed heaven was opened
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in the physical appearance of a dove. And a voice came from heaven, saying “You are my Son – the Beloved; in you I delight.”
\p
\v 23 When Jesus himself was beginning [his ministry] he was about thirty years old. He was – as it was supposed – a son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
\v 24 the son of Matthan, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Joannas, the son of Joseph,
\v 25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Nagge,
\v 26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,
\v 27 the son of Joannas, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri,
\v 28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Kosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,
\v 29 the son of Joses, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
\v 30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,
\v 31 the son of Meleas, the son of Mainan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
\v 32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Naasson,
\v 33 the son of Aminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Joram, the son of Esrom, the son of Phares, the son of Judah,
\v 34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nachor,
\v 35 the son of Saruch, the son of Ragau, the son of Phalek, the son of Eber, the son of Sala,
\v 36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
\v 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahaleleel, the son of Cainan,
\v 38 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

\v 1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the desert.
\v 2 For forty days he was tempted by the devil. He did not eat anything during those days, and afterwards, when they had come to an end, he was hungry.
\v 3 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”
\p
\v 4 But Jesus answered him, saying, “It is written, ‘Not on bread alone shall a person live, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.’”
\p
\v 5 Then the devil, taking him up a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,
\v 6 and the devil said to him, “I will give you all this power and its glory, for it has been committed to me and I may give it to whomever I wish.
\v 7 Yes, it shall all be yours – if you bow down before me.”
\p
\v 8 But Jesus answered him, saying, “Get behind me Satan, for it is written, ‘You shall bow down to the Lord your God, and him only shall you worship.’”
\p
\v 9 Then he brought him to Jerusalem and stood him on the highest point of the temple, and he said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here –
\v 10 for it is written, 
\q1 ‘He will give orders to his angels concerning you, to protect you’
\m
\v 11 and, 
\q1 ‘They shall carry you in their hands
\q1  in case you should strike your foot against a stone.’\rq Psalms 90[91]:11-12\rq*
\m
\v 12 But Jesus answered him, saying, “It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”\rq Deuteronomy 6:16\rq*
\p
\v 13 When every temptation had ended the devil removed himself from him until a favourable time.
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread throughout the whole region.
\v 15 He was teaching in their synagogues, being honoured by all.
\p
\v 16 Then he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he entered the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,
\v 17 and the scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. Unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written,
\q1
\v 18 ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
\q1 because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.
\q1 He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted,
\q1 to proclaim release to captives
\q1 and recovery of sight to the blind,
\q1 to send the broken away restored,
\q1 
\v 19 to preach the favourable year of the Lord.’\rq Isaiah 61:1-2\rq*
\m
\v 20 Having rolled up the scroll, he gave it back to the attendant and sat down. Then the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him.
\v 21 He began to tell them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”
\p
\v 22 They were all speaking approvingly of him, and marvelling at the gracious words coming out of his mouth. And they said, “Is this not Joseph’s son?”
\p
\v 23 Then he said to them, “No doubt you will quote this proverb to me, ‘Physician, heal yourself’ [and say], ‘Perform here, in your home town, things just as great as those we have heard were done in Capernaum.’”
\v 24 And he said, “Truly I tell you that no prophet is acceptable in his home town.
\v 25 It is a fact, I tell you, that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came upon the whole land.
\v 26 But Elijah was sent to none of them – except to Zarephath in Sidon, to a widow woman.
\v 27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them was cleansed – except Naaman the Syrian.”
\p
\v 28 Hearing these things, everyone in the synagogue was full of indignation.
\v 29 They rose up, threw him out of the town and marched him right up to the brow of the hill on which their town had been built, in order to throw him off.
\v 30 But he, passing through the middle of them, walked away.
\p
\v 31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the Sabbaths.
\v 32 And they were amazed by his teaching because his words had authority.
\v 33 Now, in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of a foul demon, and it cried out in a loud voice,
\v 34 saying, “Ha! What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are – the Holy One of God.”
\p
\v 35 When Jesus rebuked it, saying, “Be silent and come out of him,” the demon threw him among them and departed from him, having done him no harm.
\p
\v 36 Amazement came upon everyone and they began speaking all together, one with another, saying, “What is this teaching? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they depart.”
\v 37 Then news about him spread to every corner of the surrounding countryside.
\p
\v 38 Setting off from the synagogue he went into Simon’s house. Now, Simon’s mother-in-law was laid low by a bad fever, and they made an appeal to him about her.
\v 39 So, standing over her, he rebuked the fever and it left her. And straightaway, getting up, she was ministering to them.
\v 40 At sunset everyone, all who had those who were ill with various diseases, brought them to him, and he laid his hands upon every one of them and healed them.
\v 41 And demons, taking leave of many, were crying out, saying “You are the Christ, the Son of God.” But, rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak – because they knew him to be the Christ.
\p
\v 42 At daybreak, going out, he went to a deserted place. But the crowds were searching for him, and reaching him, they hung on to him so that he might not leave them.
\v 43 But he said to them, “I must preach the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to the other towns as well, because this is why I have been sent.”
\v 44 And he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret and the crowd was pressing on him to hear the word of God.
\v 2 He saw two boats lying by the lakeside, but the fishermen had disembarked and were washing the nets.
\v 3 Getting into one of the boats – it was Simon’s – he asked him to put out a little from the land. Then, sitting down, he began teaching the crowds from the boat.
\v 4 When he had finished speaking he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”
\v 5 In reply, Simon told him, “Master, we have toiled all night and have taken nothing. But at your word I will let down the net.”
\p
\v 6 And having done that, they enclosed a great shoal of fish and their net began to tear apart.
\v 7 So they beckoned to [their] partners who were in the other boat to come and help them – and they came and filled both boats to the point that they began to sink.
\v 8 Now, when Simon Peter saw it he fell at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Leave me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.”
\v 9 For wonder had engulfed him and all who were with him because of the haul of fish that they had taken
\v 10 – and in the same way also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
\p Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching living people.”
\p
\v 11 When they had brought the boats ashore, leaving everything, they followed him.
\p
\v 12 Now, he was in one of the towns and, look! – a man full of leprosy. Seeing Jesus and falling on his face, he begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”
\p
\v 13 And stretching out a hand, he touched him and said, “I want to. Be clean!”
\p And immediately the leprosy left him.
\v 14 Then he ordered him to tell no one, “But go on your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses directed – as a testimony to them.”
\v 15 Nevertheless, the news about him spread even more, and great crowds were gathering to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
\v 16 So he withdrew into the desert, and began to pray.
\p
\v 17 One day what happened while he was teaching – and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there – was that they came from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
\v 18 And look! – some men carrying a paralysed man on a bed try to bring him inside, to put [him] down in front of him.
\v 19 Then, not finding a way in because of the crowd, they go up onto the roof and lower him down on his bed, through the tiles, right into the middle in front of Jesus.
\v 20 Seeing their faith, he then said to him, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”
\p
\v 21 Now, the scribes and the Pharisees began to think about this, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who has the power to forgive sins except God alone?”
\p
\v 22 But Jesus read their thoughts and responded, saying to them, “Why reason in your hearts?
\v 23 Which is easier? To say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you’? Or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?
\v 24 But so that you might know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins,” he said to the paralysed man, “I say to you, stand up! Pick up your bed and go home.”
\p
\v 25 Immediately, standing up in full view of them, he picked up what he had been lying on and went off to his house glorifying God.
\v 26 Then wonder overtook every one of them and they began glorifying God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”
\p
\v 27 After that he went out and saw a tax collector called Levi sitting in the tax office. He said to him, “Follow me,”
\p
\v 28 and he, leaving everything, got up and followed him.
\v 29 Levi held a great feast for him in his home, and a large number of tax collectors and others were with them, sitting at table.
\v 30 But the scribes and the Pharisees complained to his disciples saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”
\v 31 Jesus, replying, said to them, “[It is] not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are ill.
\v 32 I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
\p
\v 33 Then they asked him, “Why do John’s disciples frequently fast and pray in the same way as those of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?”
\p
\v 34 He said to them, “Can you make the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?
\v 35 But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them. Then, in those days, they shall fast.”
\p
\v 36 Then he told them a parable. “No one puts a patch of new cloth onto old clothing, or else the new will cause a tear – and also the patch of new [cloth] will not match the old.
\v 37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled – and the skins will be destroyed.
\v 38 So new wine is put into fresh wineskins and both are preserved.
\v 39 And no one who has drunk mature [wine] will shortly afterwards want the new, but will say, ‘The old is better.’”
\p
\c 6
\v 1 As he was walking through the cornfields on the second Sabbath after Passover, his disciples were plucking the ears, rubbing [them] between [their] hands, and eating [the grain].
\v 2 Some of the Pharisees asked them, “Why are you doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?”
\p
\v 3 And Jesus replied, saying to them, “Have you never read this – what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?
\v 4 How he entered the house of God and took the show-bread and ate [it], and even gave to those with him what only the priests are permitted to eat?”
\v 5 And he told them, “The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
\p
\v 6 Then this happened on another Sabbath. He entered the synagogue and began to teach. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching, whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might obtain evidence against him.
\v 8 But he knew what they were thinking. Then he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Get up and stand in the middle.” And he got up and stood [there].
\v 9 Then Jesus said to them, “I will ask you something. Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill?”
\v 10 And, looking around at them all, he said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” He did – and his hand was restored like the other.
\v 11 They, however, were filled with rage and discussed among themselves what they might do with Jesus.
\p
\v 12 It was in those days that he went out onto the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
\v 13 Then as day broke, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve from among them whom he called Apostles –
\v 14 Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas; James, son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;
\v 16 Judas, son of James; and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.
\v 17 He came down with them and stopped in a level place. A crowd of his disciples and a great number from all Judea, Jerusalem and the coastal areas of Tyre and Sidon came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases –
\v 18 and those, too, who were disturbed by unclean spirits – and they were healed.
\v 19 Everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him because power was coming from him, and he was healing them all.
\p
\v 20 He looked up at his disciples and said,
\q1 “Blessed are those who are poor,
\q1 for yours is the Kingdom of God.
\q1
\v 21 Blessed are those who hunger now,
\q1 for you will be filled.
\q1 Blessed are those who weep now,
\q1 for you will laugh.
\q1
\v 22 Blessed are you when people hate you,
\q1 and when they exclude and revile you
\q1 and drag down your name as evil on account of the Son of Man.
\q1
\v 23 Rejoice on that day and leap for joy
\q1 for, see! – your reward is great in heaven.
\q1 Their ancestors did the same to the prophets.
\q1
\v 24 But woe to you who are rich,
\q1 for you have received your consolation.
\q1
\v 25 Woe to you who are full,
\q1 for you will go hungry.
\q1 Woe to you who are laughing now,
\q1 for you will grieve and weep.
\q1
\v 26 Woe, when everyone speaks well of you,
\q1 for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.”
\m
\v 27 “But I say to you who are listening, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
\v 28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who insult you.
\v 29 To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other as well; and do not withhold even your shirt from the one who takes your coat from you.
\v 30 Give to everyone who asks of you; and from the one who takes away your possessions, do not demand [them] back.”
\p
\v 31 “Treat others in the same way as you would like them to treat you.
\v 32 And if you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive as much again.
\v 35 Instead, love your enemies and do good; and lend expecting nothing back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, for he is gracious towards the ungrateful and evil.”
\p
\v 36 “Therefore, be merciful – just as your Father is merciful.
\v 37 Do not judge, so that you might not be judged. Do not condemn, so that you might not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.”
\p
\v 38 “Give and it will be given to you – full measure, pressed down and shaken together and overflowing, they will give into your lap. For with the same measure with which you measure out, it shall be measured back to you in return.”
\p
\v 39 He told them a parable. “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch?
\v 40 The disciple is not superior to the teacher, but after being fully formed everyone will be like his or her teacher.
\v 41 And how is it that you see the speck in your brother or sister’s eye but do not notice the plank in your own eye?
\v 42 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck in your eye’ when you can not see the plank in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck in your brother or sister’s eye.
\v 43 For there is no good tree that bears rotten fruit, nor a rotten tree that bears good fruit.
\v 44 Indeed, each tree is recognised from its own fruit. You do not gather figs from thorns, nor harvest grapes from a bramble.
\v 45 From the good stored up in the heart a good person brings out what is good, and from the evil stored up in the heart the evil person brings out what is evil. For the mouth speaks what overflows from the heart.”
\p
\v 46 “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord!’ yet do not do what I say?
\v 47 Those who come to me and listen to my words and do them – I will show you what they are like.
\v 48 They are like someone building a house who both dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. Then a flood came. The water surged against that house but was not able to shift it because it had been founded upon the rock.
\v 49 And those who listen but do not act are like someone building a house upon the earth without a foundation, against which the water surged and at once it fell. And the damage to that house was enormous.”
\p
\c 7
\v 1 When he had finished saying everything in the hearing of the people he entered Capernaum.
\v 2 A man, a centurion’s servant whom he highly valued, was ill, about to die.
\v 3 Hearing about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and save his servant.
\v 4 When they came to Jesus they begged him earnestly, saying, “You will do this for him because he deserves it,
\v 5 for he loves our nation and he built the synagogue for us.”
\v 6 Jesus went with them, but by the time he was approaching the house the centurion had sent friends to him, saying, “Lord, do not put yourself out, for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.
\v 7 For the same reason, neither did I think I was worthy to meet you myself. But say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I, too, am a man under authority having soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go’, and he goes; and to another, ‘Come’, and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this’, and he does it.”
\p
\v 9 When Jesus heard this he marvelled at him, and turning to the crowd following him he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”
\v 10 Then, returning to the house, the messengers found the sick servant in good health.
\p
\v 11 The following day he was making his way to a city called Nain, and travelling with him were a good number of his disciples and a large crowd.
\v 12 As he approached the city gate, look! – a dead man is being carried out. He was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow. Quite a crowd from the city was with her.
\v 13 Seeing her, the Lord was moved with compassion for her and he said to her, “Do not cry.”
\v 14 He approached and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. Then he said, “Young man, I tell you, arise.”
\v 15 And the dead man sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.
\p
\v 16 Fear took hold of everyone, and they began glorifying God saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us,” and, “God has visited his people.”
\v 17 Then this news about him spread throughout the whole of Judea and all around the countryside.
\p
\v 18 John’s disciples told him all about these things,
\v 19 so John, summoning two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus to ask, “Are you the one who is coming or are we to look for someone else?”
\v 20 When they reached him the men said, “John the Baptiser has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is coming or are we to look for someone else?’”
\p
\v 21 At that time he healed many of [their] infirmities and diseases and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.
\v 22 Then Jesus answered them, “Go, tell John what you have seen and heard. The blind receive sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor hear the Gospel preached,
\v 23 and whoever is not offended by me is blessed.”
\p
\v 24 When John’s disciples had left he began to tell the crowds about John. “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
\v 25 No? What did you go out to see? A man dressed in elegant clothing? Listen, those in gorgeous clothes and living in luxury are in royal palaces!
\v 26 So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes! And I tell you, much more than a prophet.
\v 27 This is the one of whom it is written,
\q1 ‘Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way before you.’\rq Malachi 3:1\rq*
\m
\v 28 For I tell you that among those born of women there never was a prophet greater than John the Baptiser, and yet the least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.”
\p
\v 29 Then, hearing this, all the people and the tax collectors, being baptised with John’s baptism, acknowledged God as righteous.
\v 30 However, the Pharisees and the lawyers, not being baptised by him, rejected God’s purpose for themselves.
\p
\v 31 “With what, then, shall I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
\v 32 They are like children calling out to one another and to those sitting in the marketplace, saying, ‘We piped for you and you did not dance! We sang a lament for you and you did not weep.’
\v 33 For John the Baptiser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you say, ‘He has a demon.’
\v 34 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you say, ‘Look at the man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’
\v 35 Yet Wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”
\p
\v 36 One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. So, going into the Pharisee’s house he sat at the table.
\v 37 Then, look! – a woman of the town who is a sinner. When she learnt that he was dining in the Pharisee’s house she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil.
\v 38 Taking a place behind [him], near his feet, she was weeping aloud and bathing his feet with tears; and with the hair of her head she was wiping [them] dry. Then she was kissing his feet and anointing [them] with the perfumed oil.
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee who invited him saw this he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who, and what sort of woman, is touching him – that she is a sinner.”
\p
\v 40 Then Jesus spoke up and said to him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.”
\p He said, “Speak, teacher.” 
\p
\v 41 “There were two debtors of a particular money-lender. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty,
\v 42 and, being without [funds] to repay, he absolved them both. So which of them, would you say, will love him most?”
\p
\v 43 Simon replied, saying, “The one to whom he forgave most, I presume.”
\p He told him, “You have judged rightly.”
\v 44 Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me water for my feet, but this woman has bathed my feet with tears and wiped [them] dry with the hair of her head.
\v 45 You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from when she arrived, has not stopped kissing my feet.
\v 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with perfumed oil.
\v 47 On account of this, I tell you, her sins, her many [sins], are forgiven, because she has loved much. However, the one who is forgiven little, loves little.”
\v 48 He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”
\p
\v 49 Those dining with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”
\p
\v 50 Then he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”
\p
\c 8
\v 1 Afterwards he was travelling by town and village, preaching and proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom of God; and with him were the Twelve
\v 2 and some women who had been healed of diseases and scourges and evil spirits – Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out;
\v 3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward; and Susanna – and many others who were ministering to him from their resources.
\p
\v 4 A large crowd was gathering, for town by town they were making their way to him. He told [them] a parable.
\p
\v 5 “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing some fell by the wayside, and it was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up.
\v 6 Other [seed] fell on rock, and when it germinated it withered away because it had no moisture.
\v 7 Other [seed] fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it.
\v 8 Other [seed] fell into good soil, and it grew and produced fruit a hundred times over.” Saying this, he exclaimed, “Let anyone with ears to hear, listen.”
\p
\v 9 Then his disciples began questioning him, saying, “What does this parable mean?”
\p
\v 10 And he replied, “To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest [it is] in parables, so that when they look they might not see, and when they hear they might not understand.
\v 11 Now, this is the parable: the seed is the word of God.
\v 12 Those by the wayside are they who hear; then the devil comes and carries off the word from their heart so that they might not believe and be saved.
\v 13 Those on rock are they who, when they hear, accept the word with joy – but they have no root; they believe for a while, then in time of temptation fall away.
\v 14 That which fell into the thorns are those who hear; then, going away, they are choked by the cares and possessions and pleasures of life – and do not produce mature fruit.
\v 15 That in the good soil are those who, having heard the word, keep hold of it in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patience.
\p
\v 16 No one who has lit a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but places it on a stand so that those coming in may see the light.
\v 17 Nothing is hidden that will not become visible; nothing is secret that will not become known and be revealed.
\v 18 So listen carefully. Whoever has, will be given something; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken away.”
\p
\v 19 His mother and brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.
\v 20 It was reported to him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.”
\p
\v 21 But he, answering, said to them, “My mother and my brothers? They are those who hear the word of God and do it.”
\p
\v 22 Then this happened. One day he got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let us go over to the far side of the lake.” So they set off.
\v 23 But as they were sailing he fell asleep. Then a gale came down upon the lake and they were being swamped and were in danger.
\v 24 His disciples came to him and woke him, saying, “Master, master, we are perishing.” He woke up, rebuked the wind and the water’s raging, and they ceased, and it became calm.
\v 25 He said to them, “Where is your faith?” And they were afraid and marvelled, saying to one another, “Who is this, then, that gives orders even to the winds and to the water – and they obey him?”
\v 26 Then he landed on the Gadarene coast which is opposite Galilee.
\p
\v 27 When he disembarked onto the shore a man from the town met him. He had demons of long standing and was not wearing clothes; and he was not living in a house, but among the tombs.
\v 28 Seeing Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and in a mighty voice he said, “What am I to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me,”
\v 29 because he had command the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It had taken hold of him on many occasions and he was being guarded, bound with manacles and fetters. But breaking the shackles apart he would be driven by the demons into the deserts.
\p
\v 30 Jesus questioned him, asking, “What is your name?”
\p He replied, “Legion”, because many demons had entered into him,
\v 31 and he begged him not to command them to go into the abyss.
\v 32 Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside, and they were begging him to allow them to go into those, and he let them.
\v 33 So, coming out of the man, the demons entered the pigs – and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake and were drowned.
\v 34 Then, seeing what had happened, the herdsmen fled and spread the news in the town and in the countryside.
\p
\v 35 They emerged to see what had happened. When they reached Jesus they found the man from whom the demons had departed at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
\v 36 So those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been delivered.
\v 37 Then a whole host of people from the surrounding Gadarene countryside asked him to leave them – because they were overcome with great fear. So, getting into the boat, he returned.
\v 38 Now, the man from whom the demons had departed was begging him to remain with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\v 39 “Return home and report what great things God has done for you.” So he went off proclaiming throughout the whole town what great things Jesus had done for him.
\p
\v 40 On Jesus’ return the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
\v 41 Then, look! – a man arrives, Jairus by name, a ruler of the synagogue. Falling at Jesus’ feet, he was begging him to come to his house
\v 42 because he had an only daughter about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as he went the crowds were crushing him.
\v 43 Then a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years – and who had spent on physicians all she had to live on, but could not be healed by anyone –
\v 44 approached him from behind and touched the hem of his cloak; and instantly her flow of blood stopped.
\v 45 Then Jesus said, “Who touched me?”
\p But everyone was denying [it]. Peter and those with him said, “Master, the crowds are crushing you and pressing in on all sides and you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”
\p
\v 46 Jesus said, “Someone did touch me because I am aware that power has gone out from me.”
\v 47 Then the woman, realising that she had not escaped notice, came, full of fear, and fell down before him. She revealed to him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched him, and how she had been instantly healed.
\v 48 He said to her, “Have courage, daughter. Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”
\p
\v 49 While he was still speaking someone came from the synagogue ruler’s [house], saying to him, “Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher.”
\p
\v 50 But Jesus, overhearing, responded, saying to him, “Do not be afraid. Only believe, and she shall be saved.”
\p
\v 51 When he arrived at the house he allowed no one to enter except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child.
\v 52 Everyone was wailing and lamenting her, but he said, “Do not wail. She has not died but is sleeping.”
\p
\v 53 But they laughed at him, knowing that she had died.
\v 54 He sent them out, and, taking hold of her hand, he called out, saying, “Child, arise!”
\v 55 Then her spirit returned and at once she got up; and he directed that something should be given to her to eat.
\v 56 Her parents were amazed, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 Calling together his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
\v 2 He sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick,
\v 3 and he said to them, “Take nothing for the journey: no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no second shirt.
\v 4 Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.
\v 5 As for those who do not welcome you, when you leave that town, shake even the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.”
\p
\v 6 They set out and began travelling through the various villages, preaching and healing everywhere.
\p
\v 7 Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was being done by him and was perplexed – because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
\v 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some prophet from long ago had risen.
\v 9 So Herod said, “John I have beheaded; who, then, is this about whom I am hearing such things?” And he wanted to see him.
\p
\v 10 When the apostles returned they reported to him what great things they had done. Then, taking them, he withdrew privately to a deserted place [near] a town called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But the crowds, realising, followed him.
\p Welcoming them, he then began telling them about the Kingdom of God; and he cured those who needed healing.
\v 12 When the day began to wane the Twelve, approaching, said to him, “Send the crowd away so that they can make their way to the villages and farms round about to lodge and to find food, because we are in a lonely place here.”
\p
\v 13 But he said to them, “You give them something to eat,”
\p and they replied, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish – unless we are to go off to buy food for all these people.”
\v 14 For there were about five thousand men.
\p Then he said to them, “Make them sit in companies – fifty in each.”
\v 15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.
\v 16 Then, taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke them and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
\v 17 And they ate, and all were satisfied. Then twelve baskets of surplus broken pieces were collected.
\p
\v 18 It happened as he was praying alone – the disciples were with him – that he questioned them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”
\p
\v 19 In reply they said, “John the Baptiser; and others, Elijah; and others, that some prophet from long ago has risen.”
\p
\v 20 He said to them, “And you, who do you say that I am?”
\p Peter answered. He said, “The Christ of God.”
\p
\v 21 Then, charging them, he insisted that they tell this to no one,
\v 22 saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed – and be raised on the third day.”
\p
\v 23 He said to them all, “Those who want to come after me must deny themselves, take up their cross every day, and follow me.
\v 24 For those who want to save their life shall lose it; but those who lose their life for my sake, they shall save it.
\v 25 For how does anyone profit by gaining the whole world, but losing – or forfeiting – themself?
\v 26 Because those who are ashamed of me and of my words, of them the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and [the glory] of the Father and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I tell you truly that some of those standing here will not taste death until they see the Kingdom of God.”
\p
\v 28 It happened about eight days after these sayings that, taking Peter and John and James, he went up into the mountain to pray,
\v 29 and as he was praying the appearance of his face was changed, and his clothing [became] dazzlingly white.
\v 30 Then, look! – there are two men talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah
\v 31 who had appeared in glory. They spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 32 Now, Peter and those who were with him were weighed down with sleep, but becoming wide awake they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
\v 33 It happened as they were leaving him that Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah” – not realising what he was saying –
\v 34 and as he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
\v 35 Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the Beloved. Listen to him.”
\v 36 When the voice had passed Jesus was found alone. And they fell silent, and told no one at that time what they had seen.
\p
\v 37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him.
\v 38 And, listen! – a man in the crowd is calling out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you, look at my son for he is my only child.
\v 39 And see, a spirit will seize him and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him and he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and it is breaking him.
\v 40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”
\p
\v 41 Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”
\p
\v 42 As the boy was coming forward the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
\p
\v 43 And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. As they all marvelled at everything that Jesus was doing he said to his disciples,
\p
\v 44 “Bend your ears to these words, for the Son of Man is about to be delivered up into human hands.”
\v 45 But they did not understand what was being said. It was hidden from them so that they should not grasp its meaning, and they were afraid to ask him about this matter.
\p
\v 46 A dispute arose among them about which of them might be the greatest.
\v 47 Jesus, seeing what they were thinking in their hearts, caught up a small child, stood him at his side,
\v 48 and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this infant in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me welcomes him who sent me. Truly, the least important of you all – he is the great one.”
\p
\v 49 John began to speak. “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he is not a disciple with us.”
\p
\v 50 Jesus said to him, “Do not try to stop him because he does not belong to us, for whoever is not against us is for us.”
\p
\v 51 It was when the time was approaching for him to be taken up that he resolutely set his face to travel on to Jerusalem.
\v 52 He sent messengers ahead of him, and on their way they entered a Samaritan village to make ready for him.
\v 53 But the people would not welcome him because his face was turned towards Jerusalem.
\v 54 When his disciples James and John saw [this] they said, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them, just as Elijah did?”
\p
\v 55 Turning around, he rebuked them and said, “You have no notion of what is inspiring you.
\v 56 The Son of Man did not come to destroy people’s lives but to save them.”
\p And they travelled on to another village.
\v 57 As they went on their way someone said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”
\p
\v 58 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
\p
\v 59 He said to another, “Follow me.”
\p But the man said, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
\p
\v 60 Jesus replied, “Let the dead bury their own dead. As for you, go away and proclaim the Kingdom of God.”
\p
\v 61 Yet another said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to those at home.”
\p
\v 62 Jesus said to him, “No one who has put a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.”
\p
\c 10
\v 1 After this the Lord also appointed seventy others and sent them in pairs on ahead of him to every town and locality where he was about to go.
\v 2 Then he said to them, “The harvest is indeed plentiful but the labourers few. So pray to the Lord of the harvest that he may send out labourers into his harvest.
\v 3 Be on your way. Listen! – I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
\v 4 Take no purse, no bag, no sandals; greet no one on the road;
\v 5 and whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house’
\v 6 and if a person of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 Remain in that house eating and drinking what they have, for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.
\v 8 And whatever town you enter where they welcome you, eat what is set before you,
\v 9 and heal those in it who are ill, and tell them, ‘The Kingdom of God has come close to you.’
\v 10 But whatever town you enter where they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say,
\v 11 ‘Even the dust from your town that clings to us on our feet, we brush off against you. But understand this: the Kingdom of God has come near to you.’
\v 12 I tell you that it will be more tolerable on that Day for Sodom than for that town.
\p
\v 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes;
\v 14 and at the judgement it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
\v 15 And you, Capernaum, would you be exalted up to heaven? You will be brought down to hades.
\v 16 Whoever listens to you, listens to me; and whoever rejects you, rejects me; and whoever rejects me, rejects the one who sent me.”
\p
\v 17 The seventy returned with joy saying, “Lord, even the demons are obedient to us in your name.”
\v 18 Then he said to them, “I was watching Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
\v 19 Listen! I give you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall harm you.
\v 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits obey you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”
\p
\v 21 At that moment Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I thank you Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this was your delight.”
\p
\v 22 Then, turning to the disciples, he said, “Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father and no one understands who the Son is, except the Father; nor who the Father is, except the Son and the one to whom the Son chooses to make [him] known.”
\p
\v 23 Again, turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see,
\v 24 for I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see, but they did not see [them]; and to hear what you hear, but they did not hear [them].”
\p
\v 25 Then, look! – one of the lawyers stands up, testing him, and asking, “Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?”
\p
\v 26 He said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read [it]?”
\p
\v 27 Answering, he said, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself.”
\p
\v 28 He told him, “You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”
\p
\v 29 But he, wanting to put himself in the right, asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbour?”
\p
\v 30 Jesus replied, “There was a man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers; and having stripped him and inflicted wounds they left, leaving [him] half dead.
\v 31 There was a priest who happened to be going down by that road but, seeing him, he crossed over to the other side.
\v 32 In the same way a Levite also happened upon the place, came and looked, and crossed over to the other side.
\v 33 Then there was a travelling Samaritan who came across him, and seeing him he was moved with compassion.
\v 34 He came up and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and lifting him onto his own animal, he led him to an inn and took care of him.
\v 35 Then in the morning, on leaving, he took out two denarii which he gave to the innkeeper and said to him, ‘Take care of him, and whatever you spend in addition I will repay you on my return.’
\v 36 So which of these three, do you think, became a neighbour to the one who fell among robbers?”
\p
\v 37 He replied, “The one who showed mercy towards him.”
\p Then Jesus told him, “Go and do the same.”
\p
\v 38 As they went on their way he entered a village and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.
\v 39 She had a sister called Mary who sat at Jesus’ feet and listened to what he said.
\v 40 However, Martha was distracted with a lot of serving. She came up to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me.”
\p
\v 41 But Jesus said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.
\v 42 Only one thing is needed. Mary has made the good choice. It shall not be taken away from her.”
\p
\c 11
\v 1 He was praying in a certain place. When he finished one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”
\p
\v 2 And he said to them, “When you pray say, 
\q1 ‘Our Father who is in heaven, 
\q2 hallowed be your name.
\q1 Your Kingdom come.
\q1 Your will be done,
\q2 as in heaven, so on the earth.
\q1 
\v 3 Give us each day our bread,
\q2 sufficient for the day.
\q1 
\v 4 And forgive us our sins,
\q2 even as we ourselves forgive everyone who is in debt to us.
\q1 And do not lead us into temptation,
\q2 but deliver us from the evil one.’”
\m
\p
\v 5 Then he said to them, “Who among you, having a friend, would go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves
\v 6 because a friend of mine on a journey has arrived at my house and I have nothing to set before him.’
\v 7 And he, answering from inside, says, ‘Do not pester me. The door is now shut and, like me, my children are in bed. I cannot get up to give you [anything].’
\v 8 I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him something because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
\p
\v 9 So I say to you, keep asking, and it will be given to you; keep searching, and you will find; keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.
\v 10 For everyone asking, receives; and the one searching, finds; and to the one knocking, it shall be opened.
\p
\v 11 And which father among you, if a son asks for a loaf would offer him a stone? Or, say, a fish, would offer him a snake instead of a fish?
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg would offer him a scorpion?
\v 13 So if you who are bad know about giving good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the good Spirit to those who are asking him.”
\p
\v 14 Then he cast out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone the man without speech spoke, and the people were amazed.
\v 15 But some of them said, “By Beelzeboul, the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.”
\v 16 And others, as a test, demanded from him a sign from heaven.
\v 17 But he, perceiving their thoughts, told them, “Every kingdom that is divided within itself is brought to ruin as house falls upon house.
\v 18 So if Satan is also divided within himself, how will his kingdom remain standing? – since you are saying that I am casting out demons by Beelzeboul.
\v 19 And if I am casting out demons by Beelzeboul, by whom are your own people casting them out? For this reason they shall be your judges.
\v 20 However, if by the finger of God I am casting out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
\p
\v 21 When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own estate what he has is safe;
\v 22 but when one stronger than he attacks and overpowers him, he takes away all his armour on which he had relied and divides up his spoils.
\p
\v 23 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.
\p
\v 24 When the unclean spirit leaves the person it wanders through arid places looking for rest, but, finding none, it says, ‘I will return to my home from which I came,’
\v 25 and having arrived it finds it swept and tidy.
\v 26 It then goes off and invites seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. So the last state of that person is worse than the first.”
\p
\v 27 As he was saying these things a woman called out from the crowd, saying to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts which nursed you.”
\p
\v 28 Then he replied, “Yes, and more than that. Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it.”
\p
\v 29 With the crowds gathering he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation. It searches for a sign but a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
\v 30 For, just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so too the Son of Man shall be a sign to this generation.
\v 31 The Queen of the South shall rise up at the judgement with the men of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon – but, see! – here [is] one greater than Solomon.
\v 32 The men of Nineveh shall stand up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah – but, see! – here [is] one greater than Jonah.
\p
\v 33 No one lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a measuring tub, but on a lamp stand so that those entering may see the light.
\v 34 The lamp of the body is the eye. So when your eye is clear your whole body is full of light as well; but when it is diseased your body is also full of darkness.
\v 35 So take care that the light in you is not darkness.
\v 36 If, then, your body is completely full of light, with no part in darkness, there will be total brightness – as when a lamp by shining enlightens you.”
\p
\v 37 While he was telling him these things one of the Pharisees asked him to dine with him, and going inside he sat down.
\v 38 Seeing this, the Pharisee was astonished that he had not first washed before the meal.
\v 39 But the Lord said to him, “Now, you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate, but your inside is full of extortion and wickedness.
\v 40 Have you no sense? Has the one who made the outside not also made the inside?
\v 41 Regarding the inside, give alms; then, you see, everything will be clean for you.
\v 42 But woe to you Pharisees – because you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but pass over justice and the love of God. These you should have been doing while not neglecting those others.
\v 43 Woe to you Pharisees – because you love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the market-places.
\v 44 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! – because you are like the unmarked graves [of which] the people walking above are unaware.”
\p
\v 45 In response, one of the lawyers said to him, “Teacher, by saying these things you are insulting us as well.”
\p
\v 46 But he replied, “Woe to you lawyers also – because you load people with burdens onerous to carry, burdens which you yourselves will not touch even with one of your fingers.
\v 47 Woe to you – because you build the tombs of the prophets, yet your ancestors killed them.
\v 48 In this way you acknowledge and condone the deeds of your ancestors, for they did indeed kill them – yet you build their tombs.
\v 49 Yes, this is why God’s wisdom has declared, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they will kill and persecute,’
\v 50 because the blood of all the prophets that has been spilled since the foundation of the world is required of this generation
\v 51 – from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the temple. Yes, I tell you that it will be required of this generation.
\v 52 Woe to you lawyers – because you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”
\p
\v 53 As he was saying these things to them the scribes and Pharisees began furiously to confront and interrogate him about many matters,
\v 54 ambushing him, trying to catch something from his lips with which they might accuse him.
\p
\c 12
\v 1 Meanwhile, as a crowd of tens of thousands came together, even trampling on each other, he began to speak to his disciples.
\p “Firstly, guard yourselves from the yeast – that is, the hypocrisy – of the Pharisees.
\v 2 There is nothing that has been concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not become known;
\v 3 for whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken into the ear in closed rooms will be published from the housetops.”
\p
\v 4 “I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body then after that can do no more.
\v 5 I will show you whom you should fear; fear the one who after the killing has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, be afraid of him.”
\p
\v 6 “Are not five sparrows sold for twopence? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.
\v 7 And even the hairs of your head have been counted. So do not be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.”
\p
\v 8 “I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me in the presence of others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge in the presence of the angels of God.
\v 9 But the one who denies me in the presence of others will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
\v 10 When anyone utters a word against the Son of Man it will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 11 If they should haul you before the synagogues or the rulers or the authorities, do not be anxious about how or with what to defend yourselves or what you should say,
\v 12 for at that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you ought to say.”
\p
\v 13 Someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.”
\p
\v 14 But he told him, “Man, who appointed me judge and arbitrator over you?”
\v 15 He said to them, “Watch out, and beware of all greediness. Because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of one’s possessions.”
\p
\v 16 Then he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a certain rich man yielded plentifully.
\v 17 He said to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no room to store my produce.’
\v 18 Then he said, ‘This is what I shall do. I shall demolish my barns and build bigger ones, and there I shall store all my grain and my goods.
\v 19 I shall say to my soul, “Soul, you have many good things stored away for many years. Take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.”’
\p
\v 20 But God said to him, ‘You fool. Tonight your soul will be reclaimed from you. And these things which you have prepared, to whom will they belong?’
\v 21 This is how it is with those who amass treasure for themselves but are not rich towards God.”
\p
\v 22 He said to his disciples, “This is why I am telling you not to be anxious about your life – what you are to eat; or about your body – what you are to wear.
\v 23 No! Life is more than food, and the body than clothing.
\v 24 Consider the ravens – that though they do not sow or reap, or have a storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. You are of far more value than the birds!
\v 25 Which of you by worrying can add a short extension to your life?
\v 26 So if you can not even [manage that] small thing, why are you anxious about the rest?
\v 27 Consider the lilies; how do they grow? They do not labour or spin, yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was decked out like one of these.
\v 28 And if that is how God clothes the field’s hay – which is [here] today and thrown into the clay oven tomorrow – all the more you of little faith.
\v 29 Do not set your sights on what you might eat and what you might drink. Do not be in doubt.
\v 30 Certainly, the peoples of the world do set their sights on all these things, but your Father knows that you need them.
\v 31 Instead, set your sights on the Kingdom of God – and all these things will be yours as well.
\v 32 Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the Kingdom.
\v 33 Sell your possessions and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure-house in heaven which no thief can reach, no moth can destroy.
\v 34 For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.
\p
\v 35 Fasten your belt; light the lamps.
\v 36 Be like people waiting for their master to return from the wedding so that immediately he arrives and knocks they can open up for him.
\v 37 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching when he comes. Truly I tell you that he will fasten his belt, sit them at the table, and come and serve them.
\v 38 If he should come in the second watch or in the third watch and find it so, blessed are those servants. 
\v 39 But be aware of this: if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming he would have kept watch and not allowed his house to be burgled.
\v 40 So you too, be prepared! The Son of Man comes at the time you do not expect.”
\p
\v 41 Peter said to him, “Lord, are you telling this parable for us, or for everyone?”
\p
\v 42 The Lord replied, “So who is the faithful and prudent steward whom the master sets over his household to give out the rations at the proper time?
\v 43 Blessed is that servant whom, on arrival, his master finds doing just that.
\v 44 Truly I tell you, he will set him over all his possessions.
\v 45 But what if the servant says in his heart, ‘My master is taking his time in returning’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat, and to drink, and to get drunk?
\v 46 The master of that servant will arrive on a day on which he is not expected and at an unknown time; and he will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
\v 47 That servant, who knew his master’s wishes yet did not make preparations nor do what he wanted, shall be beaten many times.
\v 48 But the one who, unknowingly, has done things deserving stripes shall receive a lesser beating. From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from those to whom much has been entrusted, much will be demanded.”
\p
\v 49 “I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already ablaze.
\v 50 But I have a baptism with which to be baptised, and how sore pressed I am until it is accomplished!
\v 51 Do you think that I have come to bestow peace upon earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on there will be five in one divided house – three against two and two against three.
\v 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father; mother against daughter and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”
\p
\v 54 He also said to the crowds, “When you see the cloud rising in the west you say at once, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it happens.
\v 55 And when a southerly wind blows you say that it will be hot, and it happens.
\v 56 Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance the sky and of the earth; how [is it that] you do not discern this moment in time?
\p
\v 57 And why, too, do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
\v 58 As you are actually on the road, on your way to the magistrate with your adversary, do your best to be released from him – in case he should drag you before the judge, and the judge should deliver you to the officer; then the officer will throw you into prison.
\v 59 I tell you, you will not get out of there until you have given back the very last penny.”
\p
\c 13
\v 1 At that time some of those present were telling him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices,
\v 2 and in response Jesus said, “Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all [the other] Galileans because they suffered such things?
\v 3 No! But I tell you that unless you repent you will all perish in the same way.
\v 4 Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them? Do you think that they were worse transgressors than all the people living in Jerusalem?
\v 5 No! But I tell you that unless you repent you will all perish in the same way.”
\p
\v 6 He then told this parable. “There was a man who had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but found none.
\v 7 He said to the vine-grower, ‘Look, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and have found none. Cut it down! Why is it wasting the ground?’
\v 8 In response, he said to him ‘Master, leave it for this year also, until I have dug around it and put on manure,
\v 9 [to see] if it will bear fruit. If not, then think about cutting it down.’”
\p
\v 10 He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
\v 11 Then, look! – a woman was there who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years. She was bent right over and completely unable to straighten up.
\v 12 When Jesus saw her he called her forward and said to her, “Woman, you have been set free from your infirmity.”
\v 13 He laid his hands on her and immediately she was straightened up and glorified God.
\p
\v 14 However, the ruler of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the congregation, “There are six days on which we should work. Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath.”
\p
\v 15 But the Lord answered him, “Hypocrites! Does not each one of you free his ox or his ass from its stall on the Sabbath and lead it off to water it?
\v 16 And this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound for – just imagine – eighteen years! Should she not be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?”
\p
\v 17 When he said these things all his adversaries were put to shame and the whole congregation rejoiced at all the glorious things that were being done by him.
\p
\v 18 He said, “What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?
\v 19 It is like a mustard seed which someone took and planted in their own garden. It grew and became a large tree and the birds of the air perched in its branches.”
\p
\v 20 Again he said, “To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
\v 21 It is like yeast which a woman took and blended into a bushel\f 13:33 \ft Lit. ‘three sata’. 1 saton = 3 gallons approx.\f* of flour until it was all leavened.”
\p
\v 22 He was travelling through towns and villages, teaching and making his way towards Jerusalem.
\v 23 Someone asked him, “Lord, are those who are saved, few?”
\p He replied,
\v 24 “Struggle to enter through the narrow gate for I tell you that many will try to enter but will not be able.
\v 25 Once the master of the house has got up and shut the door you might be standing outside, knocking on the door saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’ But he will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know you or where you are from.’
\v 26 Then you might start saying, ‘We ate in your company, and drank, and you taught in our market places.’
\v 27 But he will reply, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you have come from. Leave me, all you workers of iniquity.’
\v 28 There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust outside.
\v 29 Yet they will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south, and they shall sit down in the Kingdom of God.
\v 30 So you see, there are those who are last who shall be first, and there are those who are first who shall be last.”
\p
\v 31 The same day some Pharisees came up, saying to him, “Leave, and get away from here because Herod wants to kill you.”
\p
\v 32 But he told them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Listen! I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow; and on the third day I shall be fulfilled.
\v 33 Nevertheless, today and tomorrow and the day after I must travel on, for it cannot be that a prophet should die outside Jerusalem.’
\p
\v 34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem! She who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often have I longed to gather up your children as a hen [gathers] her brood under [her] wings, but you were not willing.
\v 35 See! – your house is being abandoned, deserted. I tell you that you will not see me until I come, when you will say, ‘Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord.’”
\p
\c 14
\v 1 It happened, as he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.
\v 2 Then, look! – in front of him – a man who has oedema.
\v 3 Jesus reacted by saying to the lawyers and Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
\p
\v 4 They remained silent.
\p But, taking hold of him, he healed him and let him go.
\v 5 He said to them, “Which of you, if a son or an ox falls into a well would not pull it out immediately on a Sabbath day?”
\p
\v 6 But to this they could give him no answer.
\p
\v 7 Then he told a parable to those who had been invited when he noticed how they chose the best seats. He said to them,
\v 8 “When you are invited by someone to marriage celebrations, do not sit in the best seat. Perhaps someone of greater honour than you has been invited by him,
\v 9 and then, on arrival, he who invited you both will tell you, ‘Give the place to this person.’ Then, in embarrassment, you would proceed to take the lowliest place.
\v 10 Instead, when you are invited go and sit in the lowest place so that when your host arrives he might say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honoured in the presence of those sitting with you.
\v 11 For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”
\p
\v 12 He also said to the one who had invited him, “When you give a lunch or a dinner do not call your friends, nor your brothers and sisters, nor your relatives, nor your rich neighbours, because they might invite you in return and you will be paid back.
\v 13 Instead, when you have a party call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.
\v 14 You will be blessed because they do not have the means to pay you back, but you will be paid back at the resurrection of the righteous.”
\p
\v 15 Hearing this, someone at the table said to him, “Blessed is the one who shall dine in the Kingdom of God.”
\p
\v 16 He said to him, “There was a man who held a great feast and invited many.
\v 17 At supper time he sent his servant to tell those invited, ‘Come, because everything is now ready.’
\v 18 But, as one, they all asked to be excused.
\p The first told him, ‘I have bought a field and need to go out and see it. I beg you, consider me excused.’
\p
\v 19 And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen and I am going off to try them out. I beg you, consider me excused.’
\p
\v 20 And another said, ‘I have married a wife and because of this I am not able to come.’
\p
\v 21 That servant, approaching his master, reported all this. Then the enraged householder said to his servant, ‘Quickly! Go out into the streets and alleys of the town and lead in the poor, the severely disabled, the infirm and the blind.’
\p
\v 22 The servant said, ‘Lord, what you ordered has been done and still there is room.’
\p
\v 23 And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out into the roads and hedgerows and make them come in, so that my house may be completely filled.
\v 24 For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.’”
\p
\v 25 Great crowds were travelling with him, and he turned and said to them,
\v 26 “Anyone who comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters – yes, and his own life too – cannot be my disciple.
\v 27 Whoever does not lift up his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
\v 28 For which of you, wanting to build a tower, would not first sit down and count the cost, to see if you have enough to complete it?
\v 29 Otherwise, having laid a foundation and not being able to finish it, everyone looking on will start mocking you,
\v 30 saying, ‘They cannot finish what they began to build!’
\v 31 Or what king, going out to engage another king in battle, would not first sit down and consider whether with ten thousand he is able to meet the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?
\v 32 If he cannot, while the other is still far away he sends emissaries to ask for conditions of peace.
\v 33 So, in the same way, all those who do not renounce everything they have cannot be my disciples.
\p
\v 34 Salt is good, but if it becomes tasteless what can make it salty again?
\v 35 It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap; it is thrown out. Let those who have ears for listening, listen.
\p
\c 15
\v 1 All the tax collectors and sinners were closing in to listen to him.
\v 2 But the Pharisees and scribes were grumbling, saying, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”
\p
\v 3 So he told them this parable, saying,
\v 4 “What man among you who has a hundred sheep, losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?
\v 5 And when he finds it he carries it joyfully on his shoulders.
\v 6 Arriving home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, telling them, ‘Rejoice with me! I have found my sheep, the one which was lost.’
\v 7 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents rather than over ninety-nine who are righteous and need no repentance.
\p
\v 8 Or what woman who has ten silver pieces, if she loses one, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
\v 9 And when she finds it she calls together her friends and neighbours, saying, ‘Rejoice with me! I have found the piece which I lost.’
\v 10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”
\p
\v 11 He said, “There was a man who had two sons,
\v 12 and the younger of them said to the father, ‘Father, give me the share of the property which falls to me.’ So the father divided his livelihood between them.
\v 13 Then, not many days later, gathering everything together the younger son went abroad to a distant country and there he squandered his property, living riotously.
\v 14 When he had spent everything a terrible famine occurred in that country and he himself began to be in need.
\v 15 So he went and bound himself to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.
\v 16 And he longed to fill his stomach with the husks that the pigs were eating but no one gave him anything.
\v 17 When he came to himself he said, ‘How many of those employed by my father have more than enough bread while I am dying of hunger.
\v 18 I will get up and go to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
\v 19 No longer am I worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your workers.”’
\p
\v 20 So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was moved with compassion and, running, he fell on his neck and kissed him.
\v 21 Then the son said, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. No longer am I worthy to be called your son.’
\p
\v 22 But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him. Give [him] a ring for his hand and shoes for the feet.
\v 23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let us eat and celebrate
\v 24 because my son here was dead and is alive again; he was lost and has been found.’ And they began to celebrate.
\p
\v 25 Now his elder son was on the farm and as he returned, nearing the house, he heard music and dancing.
\v 26 Calling one of the menservants he asked what was happening,
\v 27 and he replied, ‘Your brother has arrived and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has got him back safe and sound.’
\v 28 But he was angry and would not go in. So his father came out and begged him.
\v 29 But he answered the father, ‘Look, for many years I have served you and never disobeyed your orders, yet not once have you given me a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends.
\v 30 But when your son arrived, this person who has eaten up your property on prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’
\p
\v 31 The father said to him, ‘Child, you are always with me and everything of mine is yours.
\v 32 But it was right to celebrate and be glad because this, your brother, was dead and is alive again; he was lost and has been found.’”
\p
\c 16
\v 1 He also said to his disciples, “There was a rich man who had a steward. An accusation was brought that this man was squandering his possessions.
\v 2 He summoned him and said, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship for you can no longer be steward.’
\p
\v 3 The steward said to himself, ‘What shall I do now that my master is taking away the stewardship from me? I am not able to dig. I am ashamed to beg.
\v 4 I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship there will be those who will accept me into their homes.’
\v 5 Summoning each of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, ‘How much do you yourself owe to my master?’,
\v 6 and he replied, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ He told him, ‘Take your account, sit down quickly and write fifty.’
\v 7 Then he said to another, ‘And you, how much do you owe?’ And he replied, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He told him, ‘Take your account and write eighty.’
\p
\v 8 His master applauded the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently, for the children of the present age are more prudent than the children of the light with respect to their own generation.
\v 9 I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth so that when it fails you, you may be accepted into the eternal dwelling places.
\v 10 The one who is trustworthy in the smallest matter is also trustwothy with something great, and the one who is dishonest in the smallest matter is also dishonest with something great.
\v 11 Therefore, if you have not been trustworthy with unrighteous wealth, who will trust you with true [riches]?
\v 12 And if you have not been trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?
\v 13 No household servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or he will be loyal to one and think little of the other. You cannot serve God and money.”
\p
\v 14 Hearing all this, even the Pharisees – who loved money – scoffed at him.
\v 15 He told them, “You are the ones who, in the sight of the people, make yourselves out to be righteous, but God knows your hearts. For what the people look up to [is] an abomination in the sight of God.
\v 16 Until John, [it was] the law and the prophets; since then, [it is] the proclamation of the Kingdom of God – and everyone is struggling to get in.
\v 17 Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the tiniest pen stroke to drop out of the law.
\v 18 Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and everyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”
\p
\v 19 “There was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen; he revelled in luxury every day.
\v 20 And there was a poor man, Lazarus by name, who had been deposited at his gate covered in sores.
\v 21 He longed to be fed from the crumbs that were falling from the rich man’s table, and even the dogs came and licked his sores.
\v 22 It happened that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. Then the rich man died as well, and was buried.
\v 23 And in hades, suffering torments, he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom.
\v 24 And he cried out; he said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.’
\p
\v 25 But Abraham replied, ‘Child, remember that in your life you received your good things, and by the same token Lazarus received the bad things; but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
\v 26 And besides all that, between us and you a great chasm has been established, so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot, nor may they cross over from there to us.’
\p
\v 27 He said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father’s house,
\v 28 for I have five brothers – that he may plead with them so that they, too, do not come to this place of torment.’
\p
\v 29 Abraham told him, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them.’
\p
\v 30 He said, ‘No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent.’
\p
\v 31 And Abraham said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.’”
\p
\c 17
\v 1 Then he began explaining to his disciples, “It is impossible for snares leading to sin not to occur, but woe betide the one through whom they come.
\v 2 It would be better to have a millstone hung around the neck and to be thrown into the sea than to ensnare one of these little ones.
\v 3 Watch yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. And if he repents, forgive him.
\v 4 If seven times in the day he sins against you and seven times in the day he comes back to you saying, ‘I repent’, you shall forgive him.”
\p
\v 5 So then the apostles asked the Lord, “Increase our faith.”
\p
\v 6 The Lord said, “If you have faith – even like a mustard seed – you could tell this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and be planted in the sea!’ And it would obey you.
\p
\v 7 Now, who among you with a servant ploughing or tending the flock, would say to him when he came in from the fields, ‘Come along at once; take a seat at the table.’
\v 8 No, you will tell him, ‘Get my supper ready; get dressed and wait on me while I eat and drink. Afterwards, you can eat and drink.’
\v 9 Does he thank that servant for doing what was demanded? I think not.
\v 10 So you too, when you have done everything you have been commanded, continue to say, ‘We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do.’”
\p
\v 11 It happened as he was making his way to Jerusalem that he was passing between Samaria and Galilee,
\v 12 and on entering a village, ten men – lepers who kept their distance – met him.
\v 13 They raised their voices, calling, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.”
\v 14 When he saw them he said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And what happened was that on their way they were made clean.
\p
\v 15 One of them, seeing that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.
\v 16 He fell on his face at his feet, giving him thanks. And this man was a Samaritan.
\v 17 Then Jesus said, “Surely ten were made clean. The nine – where are they?
\v 18 Was no one found to turn back and give glory to God except this foreigner?”
\v 19 Then he said to him, “Rise! Go on your way. Your faith has healed you.”
\p
\v 20 Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he replied, “The coming of the Kingdom of God can not be observed.
\v 21 They will not say, ‘Look! – here!’ or ‘Look! – there!’, because, you see, the Kingdom of God is inside you.”
\p
\v 22 And he said to the disciples, “Days will come when you yearn to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
\v 23 Then they will tell you, ‘Look! – here!’, ‘Look! – there!’ Do not go there. Do not run after them.
\v 24 For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so shall it be with the Son of Man in his day.
\v 25 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
\v 26 As it was in the time of Noah so it will be in the time of the Son of Man.
\v 27 People were eating, drinking, getting married, being given in marriage until the day Noah went into the ark. And the flood came and wiped out every single one of them.
\v 28 It was the same in the time of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building.
\v 29 But on the day Lot left Sodom [the Lord] rained fire and sulphur from heaven and wiped out every single one of them.
\v 30 It will be the same on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
\v 31 On that day whoever is on the rooftop, with his possessions in the house, should not go down to fetch them. In the same way, whoever is in the field should not turn back.
\v 32 Remember Lot’s wife!
\v 33 Whoever seeks to save his life shall lose it and whoever loses his life shall save it.
\v 34 I tell you, on that night there will be two in the same bed. One will be taken and the other left.
\v 35 Two women will be grinding in the same place. One will be taken and the other left.
\v 36 Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.”
\p
\v 37 Replying, they said, “Where, Lord?”
\p He said to them, “Where the carcase is, there the vultures will gather.”
\p
\c 18
\v 1 He also told them a parable about the need for them to pray all the time and not grow weary.
\v 2 He said, “There was a judge in a certain town who did not fear God and did not care about anyone.
\v 3 A widow lived in that city who was always coming to him, saying, ‘Avenge me of my adversary!’
\v 4 For a while he would not. But then he said to himself, ‘Although I do not fear God nor care about anyone,
\v 5 yet. because this widow is giving me trouble. I will avenge her. Otherwise her coming and going will finally get me down.’”
\p
\v 6 The Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
\v 7 Does God not grant justice to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, bearing patiently with them?
\v 8 I tell you he will avenge them quickly. And yet, when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on earth?”
\p
\v 9 He also told this parable to those who were convinced of their own righteousness while despising everyone else.
\p
\v 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself in this way, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people: greedy, unrighteous, adulterous, or even like this tax collector.
\v 12 I fast twice a week. I give tithes of everything I have.’
\v 13 But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner.’
\v 14 I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home made righteous. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”
\p
\v 15 They were bringing babies to him so that he might touch them, but when the disciples saw this they rebuked them.
\v 16 Jesus called the disciples to him and said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them. The Kingdom of God is for those such as these.
\v 17 Truly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child can not enter it.”
\p
\v 18 A certain ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”
\p
\v 19 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one, that is, God.
\v 20 You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’ ‘Honour your father and your mother.’”
\p
\v 21 But he said, “I have kept all these from my youth.”
\p
\v 22 Hearing this, Jesus said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have, distribute it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
\p
\v 23 But when he heard this he became deeply grieved because he was extremely rich.
\p
\v 24 When Jesus saw his great sorrow he said, “How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the Kingdom of God.
\v 25 It is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the Kingdom of God.”
\p
\v 26 Then those listening asked, “So who can be saved?”
\p
\v 27 He replied, “What is impossible for human beings is possible for God.”
\p
\v 28 Peter said, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”
\p
\v 29 And he said to them, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers and sisters, or wife, or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of God
\v 30 who will not receive back many times over at this time, and in the age to come, eternal life.”
\p
\v 31 He took the Twelve aside and said to them, “Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
\v 32 For he will be handed over to the Gentiles, mocked, mistreated and spat on.
\v 33 When they have flogged him they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.”
\p
\v 34 But they grasped none of this; it was hidden from them. They did not understand what was being said.
\p
\v 35 As he was nearing Jericho there was a blind man, sitting by the road begging.
\v 36 Hearing a crowd go by, he asked what this meant.
\v 37 They brought him the news that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
\v 38 He roared out, “Jesus! You son of David! Have mercy on me.”
\v 39 Those at the front told him to keep quiet. But he barked out all the more, “You son of David! Have mercy on me.”
\p
\v 40 Stopping, Jesus ordered that he be brought to him. When he came close he asked him,
\v 41 ”What do you want me to do for you?”
\p The man replied, “Lord, that I may recover my sight.”
\p
\v 42 Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.”
\p
\v 43 Instantly the man recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, witnessing this, offered praise to God.
\p
\c 19
\v 1 He entered Jericho and was passing through.
\v 2 Then, look! – a man called by the name of Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
\v 3 He wanted to catch sight of Jesus, to see who he was, but, being short, he could not because of the crowd.
\v 4 He ran on ahead and climbed up a sycamore tree to see him as he was about to pass by.
\v 5 When Jesus reached the place he looked up and saw him and said, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly! Today I must stay at your house.”
\v 6 He hurried down and welcomed him joyfully.
\v 7 Seeing this, everyone grumbled saying, “He has gone to stay with a sinful man.”
\p
\v 8 Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of what I have I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything I repay it four times over.”
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of Abraham,
\v 10 for the Son of Man has come to seek out and save what was lost.”
\p
\v 11 While they listened to these things he went on to relate a parable because, as he was near Jerusalem, they supposed that at any moment the Kingdom of God would appear.
\v 12 He said, “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to accept a kingdom for himself and then to return.
\v 13 So, calling ten of his servants he gave them ten pounds, and said, ‘Get busy with these until I come back.’
\v 14 But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’
\p
\v 15 When he returned having accepted the kingdom he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called, to find out what they had gained by trading.
\v 16 The first approached saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made ten pounds more.’
\p
\v 17 The king said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten towns.’
\p
\v 18 Then the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made five pounds.’
\p
\v 19 And he said to this one too, ‘You shall be over five towns.’
\v 20 Another came saying, ‘Lord, look! Here is your pound which I kept wrapped in a handkerchief.
\v 21 I was afraid of you because you are a hard man. You pick up what you have not put down; you reap what you have not sown and gather up what you have not threshed.’
\p
\v 22 He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth I condemn you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a hard man, picking up what I had not put down, reaping what I had not sown and gathering up what I had not threshed.
\v 23 Why, then, did you not put my money in the bank? On my return I would have collected it with interest.’
\v 24 He said to those standing there, ‘Take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.’
\v 25 – They said, ‘Lord, he has ten pounds!’ –
\v 26 ‘Because I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given; but from those who have not, even what they have will be taken from them.
\v 27 As for those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and kill them in front of me.’”
\p
\v 28 Having said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
\v 29 As he approached Bethsphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives he sent off two of his disciples
\v 30 saying, “Make your way to the village opposite. There, as you go in, you will find a foal tied up upon which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.
\v 31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’, say to them, ‘The Lord needs it.’”
\p
\v 32 And those who were dispatched went away and found the foal standing there just as he had told them.
\v 33 While they were untying the foal its owners asked them, “Why are you letting the foal loose?”
\v 34 They replied, “Because the Lord needs it.”
\v 35 And they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks over the foal, and set Jesus upon it.
\v 36 As he went on his way they spread their cloaks beneath him on the road.
\v 37 Now on the descent from the Mount of Olives, as he came nearer, the whole company of disciples began to cheer and to praise God with a mighty voice for all the miracles they had seen,
\v 38 calling out, “Blessed is the King – he who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
\p
\v 39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher! Rebuke your disciples.”
\p
\v 40 But he answered them, “I tell you that if these were silent the stones would cry out.”
\p
\v 41 When he came closer he saw the city and wept over it,
\v 42 saying, “On this your day if you, yes you, had only recognised where your peace lay! But now it is hidden from your sight.
\v 43 For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a fortification against you, surround you and hem you in on every side.
\v 44 They will raze you to the ground with your children within you. They will not leave in you one stone upon another. All because you did not recognise the moment when you were visited.”
\p
\v 45 Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those in it who bought and sold,
\v 46 saying to them, “It is written that ‘my house is a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of thieves.”
\p
\v 47 He was teaching daily in the temple while the chief priests and the scribes and other prominent people were seeking to destroy him, 
\v 48 but they could not find a way to do it because all the people were hanging on his every word.
\p
\c 20
\v 1 On one of those days when he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Gospel it happened that the chief priests and scribes with the elders were present.
\v 2 They asked him, “Tell us by what authority you are doing all this? Who gave you this authority?”
\p
\v 3 He replied, saying to them, “I will ask you one question as well. Tell me about
\v 4 the baptism of John. Was it from heaven or of human origin?”
\p
\v 5 They discussed it among themselves. “If we were to say, ‘From heaven’ he would reply, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
\v 6 But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ all the people will stone us because they are convinced that John was a prophet.”
\v 7 So they replied that they did not know where it was from.
\p
\v 8 And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do all this.”
\p
\v 9 He began to tell the people this parable. “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to vine-growers and went abroad for a long time.
\v 10 At the appropriate season he sent a servant to the growers to collect some of the produce of the vineyard. But the vine-growers beat him up and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 11 Once again he sent a servant to them, another one, and they beat him up too, showed him no respect and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 12 He sent yet a third. They wounded him as well and threw him out.
\v 13 Then the master of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps when they see him they will show respect.’
\p
\v 14 But when the vine-growers saw him they debated among themselves saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.’
\v 15 They forced him out of the vineyard and killed him. So what will the master of the vineyard do to them?
\v 16 He will come and slaughter those vine-growers and give the vineyard to others.”
\p When the people heard this they said, “May it never happen!”
\p
\v 17 And he looked at them and said, “Then what is this that is written? 
\q1 ‘The stone which the builders rejected
\q1 has become the chief cornerstone.\rq Psalms 117[118]:22\rq*
\q1 
\v 18 Everyone who falls over that stone will be dashed to pieces,
\q1 and the one on whom it falls will be ground to dust.’

\p
\v 19 At that moment the chief priests and the scribes wanted to lay hands on him because they knew he had spoken the parables against them, but they feared the people.
\v 20 They watched him and sent out spies who pretended to be genuine so they might catch him out in what he said and then hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.
\v 21 They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right and do not go by appearances but truly teach God's way.
\v 22 Are we allowed to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
\p
\v 23 But he saw through their duplicity and said to them, “Why do you set a trap for me?
\v 24 Show me a coin. Whose image and inscription does it carry?”
\p They answered, “Caesar’s.”
\p
\v 25 He said to them, “Well then, give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.”
\p
\v 26 So they were not able to catch him out in what he said in front of the people. Astonished at his answer they fell silent.
\p
\v 27 Some of the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection approached him and questioned him.
\v 28 They said, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone’s brother – who has a wife – dies childless, that brother should marry the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.
\v 29 Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and died childless.
\v 30 The second took the wife and that one died childless.
\v 31 The third took her, and similarly all seven; they died leaving no children.
\v 32 Last of all the woman died.
\v 33 So at the resurrection, of which one will she be the wife? For she was wife to the seven of them.”
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, “The children of this age marry and are given in marriage,
\v 35 but those judged worthy of that age and of the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 They cannot die any more because they are like angels; they are children of God, children of the resurrection.
\v 37 But that the dead are raised Moses himself declared at the bush when he called the Lord ‘The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’
\v 38 He is God not of the dead but of the living, because all are alive to him.”
\p
\v 39 Some of the scribes said, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”
\v 40 And they did not dare question him about anything else.
\p
\v 41 He asked them, “How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son?
\v 42 David himself says in the book of the Psalms, 
\q1 ‘The Lord said to my Lord
\q1 sit at my right hand
\q1 
\v 43 until I make your enemies your foot-rest.’\rq Psalms 109[110]:1\rq*
\m
\v 44 David, then, calls him Lord; so how is he his son?”
\p
\v 45 With all the people listening he said to his disciples,
\v 46 “Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted in the marketplaces. They love the front seats in the synagogues and top table at feasts.
\v 47 They, who gobble up widows’ houses and for outward show pray at great length, will receive an especially severe condemnation.”
\p
\c 21
\v 1 Looking up, he watched those who were throwing their gifts into the treasury, rich people.
\v 2 Then he saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins.
\v 3 He said, “Truly I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than everyone,
\v 4 for all the others put in gifts for God from their surplus but she, from her deficit, put in all she had in life.”
\p
\v 5 Some were saying about the temple that was adorned with beautiful stones and votive offerings. He said,
\v 6 “These things you gaze at – the days will come when not one stone will remain upon another stone without being thrown down.”
\p
\v 7 Then they asked him, “Teacher, when will this happen? What is the sign that this is about to take place?”
\p
\v 8 He replied, “Watch out that you are not led astray, for many will come in my name saying, ‘I am the one!’ and, ‘The time has come!’ Do not go after them.
\v 9 When you hear of wars and disturbances do not be scared because these things must take place first, but the end will not happen at once.”
\v 10 Then he said to them, “Nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
\v 11 There will be huge earthquakes and famines and plagues everywhere. There will be terrors and mighty signs from heaven.”
\p
\v 12 “Before all these things happen they will lay hands on you and persecute you. You will be handed over to synagogues, put under arrest, brought before kings and governors because of my name.
\v 13 For you it will become a testimony,
\v 14 so determine in your hearts not to practise in advance what to say in your defence,
\v 15 for I will give you speech and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to refute or resist.
\v 16 You will be handed over even by parents and neighbours and friends and brothers and sisters, and they will put some of you to death.
\v 17 You will be hated by everyone because of my name,
\v 18 yet not a hair on your head shall perish.
\v 19 By your endurance you will gain your souls.”
\p
\v 20 “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies then you will know that her ruination draws near.
\v 21 Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains; let those in Jerusalem get out; let those in the countryside not enter the city.
\v 22 These are the days of her punishment so that everything that has been written might be fulfilled.
\v 23 Pity those who are pregnant and those breast-feeding in those days, for at that time there will be great distress across the land and wrath against this people.
\v 24 They shall fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the proper times for the nations are complete.”
\p
\v 25 “There will be signs in sun, moon and stars, and on earth the distress of nations with perplexity from the roaring of sea and wave.
\v 26 People will faint from fear, apprehensive of what is coming upon the inhabited world, for the powers of heaven will be toppled.
\v 27 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\v 28 When these things begin to happen look up and lift up your heads because your redemption is near.”
\p
\v 29 Then he told them a parable. “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
\v 30 You yourselves know that when they bud you notice it and realise that summer is now near.
\v 31 So you, when you see these things happening understand that the Kingdom of God is near.
\v 32 Truly I say to you that this generation will not pass away until everything has happened.
\v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.”
\p
\v 34 “You yourselves, keep this in mind so that your hearts are not weighed down with hang-overs and over-indulgence and life's cares, and so that you are not unexpectedly confronted by that day.
\v 35 For it will spring like a trap upon everyone who lives on the face of the whole earth.
\v 36 Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape everything that is about to happen and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.”
\p
\v 37 Each day he taught in the temple, and each evening he went out to the Mount of Olives and spent the night there.
\v 38 Then at dawn all the people came to him at the Mount to listen to him.
\p
\c 22
\v 1 Now, the feast of unleavened bread which is called Passover was approaching.
\v 2 The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to do away with him, but they were afraid of the people.
\v 3 Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the Twelve.
\v 4 And Judas went off and consulted with the chief priests and scribes and military officers about how he might hand him over to them.
\v 5 They were pleased, and promised to give him money.
\v 6 He agreed, and set about looking for an opportunity in the absence of a crowd to hand him over to them.
\p
\v 7 Then came the day of unleavened bread when the Passover had to be sacrificed,
\v 8 so [Jesus] sent off Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us so we might eat.”
\p
\v 9 They asked him, “Where do you want us to make preparations?”
\p
\v 10 He replied, “Listen! As you enter the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house where he enters
\v 11 and tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’
\v 12 He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make the preparations there.”
\p
\v 13 They went and found just what he had told them and prepared for the Passover.
\v 14 When the time came he sat down with the twelve apostles
\v 15 and said to them, “I have had a great longing to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
\v 16 for I tell you that I will not be eating it again until it is made perfect in the Kingdom of God.”
\v 17 Then he took a cup, gave thanks and said, “Take this and share it among you,
\v 18 for I tell you that I shall never drink again of the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.”
\p
\v 19 Then he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and gave it to them saying, “This is my body which is being given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”
\v 20 And likewise the cup, after the meal, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is being poured out for you.
\v 21 Now, listen! – the hand of the one who is betraying me is with me at the table.
\v 22 The Son of Man is indeed going on his way as it has been ordained, but woe to that man by whom he is being betrayed.”
\p
\v 23 Then they began to speculate among themselves which of them it might be who was about to do this.
\p
\v 24 And an argument arose among them about which of them was reckoned to be the greatest.
\v 25 So he said to them, “The kings of the nations exercise lordship over them – and those who wield power over them are called benefactors.
\v 26 But for you it is not like that. No, the one who is the greatest among you, let him be like the youngest; and the one who is in charge like the one who serves.
\v 27 For who is greater: the one sitting at the table or the one serving? Is it not the one sitting down? Yet I am among you as the one who is serving.
\v 28 And you? You are the ones who have stayed with me throughout my trials,
\v 29 and just as my Father bestowed upon me a kingdom, I bestow [one] upon you
\v 30 so that you might eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”
\p
\v 31 Then the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Satan, you see, wanted to sift you like wheat.
\v 32 But I have prayed for you so that your faith might not desert you. And you, when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers and sisters.”
\p
\v 33 And he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both into captivity and to death.”
\p
\v 34 He replied, “I say to you, Peter, that the cock will not crow today before you have denied three times that you know me.”
\p
\v 35 Then he asked them, “When I sent you out without a purse or a bag or sandals did you lack anything?”
\p They said, “Nothing.”
\p
\v 36 He said to them, “But now, whoever has a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and whoever does not have a sword should sell his coat and buy one,
\v 37 for I say to you that what has been written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was numbered with transgressors,’ for the things concerning me have a fulfilment.”
\p
\v 38 They said, “Lord, look! – here are two swords.” He said to them, “That is enough.”
\p
\v 39 Then, going out, he went as usual to the Mount of Olives and his disciples followed him.
\v 40 Reaching the place he said to them, “Pray that you do not come into temptation.”
\p
\v 41 He then withdrew himself from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down and began to pray
\v 42 saying, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will but yours be done.”
\p
\v 43 And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
\v 44 Being in agony he was praying more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling to the ground.
\p
\v 45 When he rose up from prayer and went back to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief.
\v 46 He said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Wake up! And pray that you do not come into temptation.”
\p
\v 47 While he was speaking, look! – a crowd appears, and the one called Judas, one of the Twelve, is leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him – for this sign had been given to them, “The one whom I kiss is the man –
\v 48 but Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”
\p
\v 49 When those around him saw what was about to happen they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”
\v 50 One of them struck the servant of the High Priest and took off his right ear,
\v 51 but Jesus’ response was, “Stop! That is enough” — and he touched his ear and healed him.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to those who had come upon him – chief priests and temple officers and elders – “Have you come out as against a bandit with swords and staves?
\v 53 When I was with you daily in the temple you did not stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, the rule of darkness.”
\p
\v 54 Seizing him, they led him away and brought him to the High Priest’s house. And Peter followed at a distance.
\v 55 They kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together. Peter was sitting among them.
\v 56 Now a servant girl saw him sitting in the firelight, and looking closely at him she said, “This man was also with him.”
\p
\v 57 But he denied it saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”
\p
\v 58 After a while someone else saw him and said, “You are also one of them.”
\p But Peter answered, “Man, I am not.”
\p
\v 59 After a space of an hour or so some other person insisted, saying, “Truly, this man was with him as well for he is a Galilean.”
\p
\v 60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And at once, while he was speaking, a cock crowed.
\v 61 Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered what the Lord had said, how he had told him, “Before the cock crows you will disown me three times.”
\v 62 Then Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 Now the men who were holding Jesus were mocking and beating him.
\v 64 When they had blindfolded him they began striking him on the face and questioning him saying, “Prophesy! Which one hit you?”
\v 65 And many other insults they threw at him.
\p
\v 66 As soon as it was day the leaders of the people came together, chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their sanhedrin saying,
\v 67 “If you are the Christ, tell us.”
\p And he replied, “If I tell you, you will not believe;
\v 68 and if I ask anything, you will not answer me or release me.
\v 69 From now on the Son of Man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.”
\p
\v 70 Then they all said, “So! You are the Son of God!”
\p He said to them, “You yourselves affirm that I am.”
\p
\v 71 Then they said, “What further need do we have of evidence? For we have heard [it] from his mouth.”
\p
\c 23
\v 1 The whole assembly rose up and brought him before Pilate.
\v 2 They began to lay charges against him, saying, “We have found this man subverting the nation, forbidding the payment of tax to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”
\p
\v 3 So Pilate questioned him saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
\p Answering him he declared, “Those are your words.”\f 23:3 \ft Literally, ‘You are saying’ \f*
\p
\v 4 Pilate said to the chief priests and to the crowd, “I find no fault in this man.”
\p
\v 5 They were all the more insistent saying, “He stirs up the people teaching throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee as far as here.”
\v 6 Now when Pilate heard ‘Galilee’ he asked if the man were a Galilean,
\v 7 and discovering that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
\p
\v 8 When Herod saw Jesus he was very pleased because he had been wanting to see him for some time. He had heard a lot about him and was hoping to see some miracle done by him.
\v 9 He was questioning him at great length but he was giving him no answer.
\v 10 The scribes and the chief priests stood by, vehemently denouncing him.
\v 11 Then Herod with his soldiers humiliated him. In derision they dressed him in a magnificent robe and sent him back to Pilate.
\v 12 Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that day, for previously they had been hostile towards each other.
\p
\v 13 Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people.
\v 14 He said to them, “You brought this man to me as one perverting the people, but, listen, under interrogation in your presence I did not find this man guilty of any of the charges you are laying against him.
\v 15 No, neither has Herod for I sent you to him and, look, nothing deserving death has been done by him.
\v 16 Therefore I will discipline him and release him,”
\v 17 for he needed to release someone for them at each feast.
\v 18 But all of them shouted out in unison, “Away with this man! Release for us Barabbas”
\v 19 – the one who had been thrown into prison on account of some insurrection in the city and for murder.
\p
\v 20 Then Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, again appealed to them,
\v 21 but they were chanting, “Crucify! Crucify him!”
\p
\v 22 For the third time he called out to them, “Why? What harm has he done? I have found in him nothing deserving death. I will discipline him and then release him.”
\v 23 But with deafening shouts they were relentless, demanding that he be crucified, and their voices and the those of the chief priests were overpowering.
\v 24 So Pilate decreed that what they asked should be done
\v 25 and he released for them Barabbas – the one who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder – as they had requested, but surrendered up Jesus to their own purposes.
\p
\v 26 As they led him away they seized Simon, someone from Cyrene, returning from the countryside. They laid the cross on him, to carry it behind Jesus.
\v 27 A great company of people were following him including women who were beating their breasts and lamenting him.
\v 28 And Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
\v 29 because, listen! – the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that have not given birth and the breasts that have not nursed.’
\v 30 Then they shall start saying to the mountains, ‘Fall on us’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us,’
\v 31 for if they do these things when the timber is wet, what will happen when it is dry?”
\p
\v 32 Others also with him, two criminals, were to be put to death.
\p
\v 33 When they reached the place called The Skull there they crucified him with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
\p
\v 34 Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.”
\p And to share his garments they threw dice.
\v 35 The people were standing by, watching, and also with them were the rulers, sneering, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God.”
\p
\v 36 The soldiers were mocking him as well, coming up and offering him vinegar
\v 37 and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”
\p
\v 38 There was even a notice inscribed over him, written in Greek and Latin and Hebrew, “This is the king of the Jews.”
\p
\v 39 One of the hanged criminals was insulting him saying, “If you are the Christ save yourself and us.”
\p
\v 40 But the other responded, rebuking him saying, “Do you not even fear God since you are under the same condemnation?
\v 41 And we indeed rightly for we are getting what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.”
\v 42 Then he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”
\p
\v 43 And Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that today you shall be with me in Paradise.”
\p
\v 44 It was now about the sixth hour and darkness fell upon the whole land until the ninth hour.
\v 45 The sun was eclipsed and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.
\v 46 Then crying with a loud voice Jesus said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” Having said this he breathed his last.
\p
\v 47 When the centurion saw what had happened he glorified God saying, “Truly this man was righteous.”
\v 48 When all the crowds that had gathered for the spectacle saw what had happened they returned, beating their breasts.
\v 49 But all who knew him stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, watching these things.
\p
\v 50 Then, look! – a man, Joseph by name, a member of the Sanhedrin and a good and righteous man
\v 51 who had not agreed with their plan and action. He was from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, and he too was waiting for the Kingdom of God.
\v 52 This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus,
\v 53 and taking him down he wrapped him in a bleached linen cloth and laid him in a tomb hewn from the rock where no one had yet been laid.
\v 54 It was Preparation Day. The Sabbath was approaching.
\v 55 The women who had come with him from Galilee had followed and seen the tomb, and where his body was laid.
\v 56 They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested, in accordance with the commandment.
\p
\c 24
\v 1 On the first day of the week just before sunrise they went to the tomb with some others, carrying the spices they had prepared.
\v 2 They discovered that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb,
\v 3 so they went in; but they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
\v 4 Then, while they were reeling from this, look! – two men in dazzling clothes appear beside them.
\v 5 They became frightened and bowed their faces to the ground.
\p [The men] said to them, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
\v 6 He is not here, but has been raised! Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,
\v 7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful people, and be crucified – and rise again on the third day.”
\p
\v 8 Then they remembered his words.
\v 9 And returning from the tomb they told all this to the Eleven, and to all the rest.
\v 10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles,
\v 11 but what they said seemed to them to be nonsense, and they did not believe them.
\v 12 But Peter set off and ran to the tomb and, stooping down, he saw the linen bandages lying by themselves. Then he went home, wondering what had happened.
\p
\v 13 Then, listen! Two of them were travelling that day to a village named Emmaus, seven miles distant from Jerusalem,
\v 14 and they were talking to one another about all these things that had occurred.
\v 15 Then it came about as they talked and reasoned together that Jesus approached and kept company with them,
\v 16 but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
\v 17 Then he said to them, “What is this bandying of words with one another all about, as you go along looking mournful?”
\p
\v 18 Responding, one of them, Cleopas by name, said to him, “Are you such a stranger in Jerusalem that you alone do not know what has happened there recently?”
\p
\v 19 He said to them, “What things?”
\p They told him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth who became a man, a prophet, powerful in deed and word in the sight of God and of all the people;
\v 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
\v 21 We were hoping that it was he who was about to redeem Israel. And besides all that, this is the third day since these things happened,
\v 22 and now some of our women have bewildered us. They went early to the tomb,
\v 23 and not finding his body they returned saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he is alive.
\v 24 Then some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.”
\p
\v 25 He said to them, “Such ignorance! And slowness of heart to believe everything the prophets have spoken!
\v 26 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, then enter into his glory?”
\v 27 And beginning with Moses and all the prophets he began to explain to them in all the Scriptures the things about himself.
\v 28 Then they approached the village where they were going and he made as if to go on further.
\p
\v 29 But they constrained him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening and the day wears on.”
\p So he went in to stay with them.
\v 30 Now what happened was that, as he sat at table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, and breaking it he gave it to them.
\v 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him – but he vanished from their sight.
\v 32 And they said one to another, “Were our hearts not burning within us while he was speaking to us on the road, and as he was opening up the Scriptures for us?”
\v 33 And starting out that very hour they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
\v 34 saying, “The Lord is risen indeed and has been seen by Simon.”
\v 35 Then they began to relate what had happened on the road and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
\p
\v 36 As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace, to you.”
\p
\v 37 They were stunned, and became fearful supposing they were looking at a ghost.
\p
\v 38 But he said to them, “Why are you in turmoil? What is the reason for the speculations welling up in your hearts?
\v 39 Look! The hands are mine and the feet are mine – because I am he. Touch me and see, for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.”
\v 40 And saying this he showed them hands and feet.
\v 41 Then they were beyond belief with joy, and marvelling. He said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?”
\p
\v 42 They gave him a portion of grilled fish and of honeycomb,
\v 43 and taking [them] he ate in their presence.
\v 44 He said to them, “This is what I told you when I was still with you, that everything written in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms about me must be fulfilled.”
\p
\v 45 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
\v 46 and he said to them, “As it has been written, so must the Christ suffer and rise from the dead the third day,
\v 47 and repentance and forgiveness be proclaimed in his name to all the nations beginning from Jerusalem.
\v 48 You are witnesses of these things.
\v 49 Now, listen! I am sending upon you the promise of my Father; so you are to wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.”
\p
\v 50 He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.
\v 51 Then what took place as he was blessing them was that he was separated from them, and was carried up into heaven.
\v 52 They worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
\v 53 and were constantly in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.
\p
