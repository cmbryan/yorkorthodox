\v 1 Since many have tried their hand at setting out an orderly narrative of all that has been clearly established among us
\v 2 as those who were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word from the start have committed it to us,
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, most noble Theophilus, having gained an accurate knowledge of everything from the beginning, to write an account for you
\v 4 so that you may have a full knowledge about what you have been taught.
\p
\v 5 In the days of Herod the king of Judaea, there was a certain priest named Zachariah of the ministry division of Abijah; and the name of his wife, a daughter of Aaron, was Elisabeth.
\v 6 They were both righteous in the sight of God and lived blamelessly by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord,
\v 7 but they had no child because Elisabeth was barren, and both were well on in years.
\p
\v 8 Now it happened while he was performing his priestly duties before God in the roster of his division,
\v 9 that according to the custom of the priesthood it was his duty to enter the sanctuary of the Lord to burn incense;
\v 10 and at the Hour of Incense a great throng of people was praying outside.
\v 11 An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense.
\v 12 When Zachariah saw him he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your prayer has been heard and your wife Elisabeth will bear a son for you, and you shall name him John.
\v 14 You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth,
\v 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink, but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.
\v 16 He will turn many of the children of Israel back to the Lord their God,
\v 17 for he will go on ahead of him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the parents to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to prepare a people made ready for the Lord.’
\p
\v 18 Zachariah said to the angel, ‘How shall I be sure of this, for I am an old man and my wife is well on in years?’
\p
\v 19 And the angel replied, telling him, ‘I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
\v 20 Now listen, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled at their proper time.’
\p
\v 21 The people were waiting for Zachariah and were surprised that he was taking so long in the sanctuary.
\v 22 Then when he came out he could not speak to them, and they realised that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was making signs to them, but remained mute.
\p
\v 23 When the time of his priestly duty was complete he returned home,
\v 24 and during those days his wife Elisabeth conceived. She hid herself for five months, saying,
\v 25 ‘The Lord has done this for me at the time he looked upon me, to take away my disgrace among the people.’
\p
\v 26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town of Galilee named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man of the house of David whose name was Joseph, and the name of the virgin was Mary.
\v 28 Going in, the angel said to her, ‘Rejoice, highly favoured one, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women.’
\p
\v 29 When she saw him she was alarmed by the words and wondered what sort of greeting this could be.
\v 30 But the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.
\v 31 Now listen, you will conceive in the womb and bear a son and you shall name him Jesus.
\v 32 He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
\v 33 He will reign over the house of Jacob into the ages and of his Kingdom there will be no end.’
\p
\v 34 Mary said to the angel, ‘How will this happen to me since I am not intimate with a man?’
\p
\v 35 And in reply the angel told her, ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the Holy One to be born will be called Son of God.
\v 36 And understand that your relative Elisabeth has herself conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren,
\v 37 for nothing at all is impossible with God.’
\p
\v 38 Mary said, ‘You see the maidservant of the Lord; let it be to me as you have spoken.’ Then the angel left her.
\p
\v 39 In those days Mary set out and went with all speed to the hill country, to a town of Judah.
\v 40 She entered the house of Zachariah and greeted Elisabeth.
\v 41 Then, when Elisabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leapt in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
\v 42 She called out in a loud voice, saying, ‘Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
\v 43 Why is this happening to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For the moment the sound of your greeting came to my ears the baby in my womb leapt for joy.
\v 45 And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what had been said to her from the Lord.’
\p
\v 46 And Mary said, ‘My soul magnifies the Lord
\v 47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,
\v 48 for he has looked upon the lowliness of his maidservant, and from now on all generations will call me blessed
\v 49 because he who is mighty has done great things for me. His name is Holy,
\v 50 and from generation to generation his mercy is for those who fear him.
\v 51 He has done a mighty deed with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
\v 52 He has thrown down the powerful from their thrones, but has lifted high the lowly.
\v 53 He has filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty.
\v 54 He has helped his servant Israel to be mindful of mercy,
\v 55 as he told our ancestors, Abraham and his offspring, through the ages.’
\p
\v 56 Mary stayed with her for about three months, then returned home.
\p
\v 57 The time came for Elisabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
\v 58 The neighbours and her relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her and they rejoiced with her.
\v 59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were for calling him by his father’s name, Zachariah.
\v 60 But his mother spoke up and said, ‘Not so. He shall be called John.’
\p
\v 61 They said to her, ‘No one in your family is called by that name.’
\v 62 And they made signs to his father as to what he wanted him to be called.
\p
\v 63 He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, ‘His name is John,’ and they were all astounded.
\v 64 Then suddenly his mouth was opened and his tongue released, and he spoke, praising God.
\p
\v 65 Fear fell upon all their neighbours, and throughout the hill country of Judaea all these things were spoken about.
\v 66 Everyone who heard took them to heart, saying, ‘What will become of this child?’ For the hand of the Lord was with him.
\p
\v 67 His father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
\v 68 ‘Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people.
\v 69 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,
\v 70 as he announced through the mouths of his holy prophets from of old:
\v 71 that he would save us from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;
\v 72 and show mercy to our ancestors, remembering his holy covenant,
\v 73 the oath which he swore to our father Abraham; and grant us,
\v 74 who have been delivered from the hand of our enemies, fearlessly to worship him
\v 75 with holiness and righteousness in his presence all the days of our life.
\pi
\v 76 ‘And you, child, shall be called Prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his paths,
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins.
\v 78 Because of the tender mercies of our God the Dawn from on high has visited us,
\v 79 to give light to those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet on to the path of peace.’
\p
\v 80 The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his revealing to Israel.
\p
\c 2
\v 1 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be registered.
\v 2 This was the first census when Cyrenius was governor of Syria,
\v 3 and everyone travelled to register, each to his own city.
\v 4 And so Joseph too went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth to Judaea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
\v 5 to register himself with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.
\p
\v 6 It happened while they were there that the time came for her to be delivered,
\v 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn.
\p
\v 8 Now there were shepherds in the same area, encamped in the pastures and guarding their flock through the night.
\v 9 An angel of the Lord stood before them and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were gripped by a great fear.
\v 10 But the angel said to them, ‘Do not be afraid, because I am bringing you good news of great joy which is for all the people,
\v 11 for today in the city of David a Saviour was born for you. He is Christ the Lord.
\v 12 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.’
\v 13 Suddenly there was with the angel a great company of the Host of Heaven, praising God and proclaiming,
\v 14 ‘Glory to God on high, and on earth peace and goodwill among people.’
\p
\v 15 Then, when the angels had gone from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.’
\p
\v 16 And so they went with speed and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.
\v 17 Looking on, they revealed what had been said to them about the child,
\v 18 and all who were listening were amazed by what the shepherds told them.
\v 19 And Mary remembered all that was said, piecing it together in her heart.
\v 20 Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.
\p
\v 21 When the eight days had passed for the child to be circumcised, he was named Jesus, having been given that name by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\v 22 And when the time came for their purification in accordance with the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,
\v 23 for it is written in the Law of the Lord that ‘every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord,’\rq Exodus 13:2,12\rq*
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice of what the Law of the Lord prescribes: ‘a brace of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.’\rq Leviticus 12:8\rq*
\p
\v 25 Now there was in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon. This righteous and devout man was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
\v 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had looked upon the Lord’s Anointed.
\v 27 He came in the Spirit into the Temple when the parents were bringing in the child Jesus to fulfil for him the custom of the Law,
\v 28 and he took him in his arms and praised God, saying,
\q1
\v 29 ‘Now, Master, you allow your servant to depart in peace according to your word.
\v 30 For my eyes have seen your salvation
\v 31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples:
\v 32 a light to enlighten the nations, and the glory of your people Israel.’
\m
\v 33 Both Joseph and the child’s mother were amazed by what was said about him.
\v 34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, ‘Understand that this child is set apart for the downfall and the rising again of many in Israel and as a sign to be disputed,
\v 35 and a sword will go right through your own soul as well, so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.’
\p
\v 36 Then there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher, who was of a great age. After living with her husband for seven years from her virginity
\v 37 she was a widow of about eighty-four years. She did not leave the Temple, worshipping with fasting and prayer night and day.
\v 38 She was there at that time giving thanks to the Lord and she spoke of him to all who were waiting patiently for redemption in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 39 When they had completed everything in accordance with the Law of the Lord they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
\v 40 The child grew and became strong in spirit, full of wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
\p
\v 41 Now each year his parents would make the journey to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover,
\v 42 and when he was twelve years old they went up to Jerusalem for the feast, as was the custom.
\v 43 The days passed, and on their return the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his mother and Joseph did not know.
\v 44 Supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey and then began looking for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
\v 45 When they did not find him, they turned back to Jerusalem to look for him.
\p
\v 46 It was three days later that they found him in the Temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
\v 47 All who heard him were astonished by his intellect and his responses.
\v 48 When they saw him they were astounded, and his mother said to him, ‘Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been anxiously looking for you.’
\p
\v 49 He asked them, ‘Why were you looking for me? Did you not realise that I had to be about my Father’s business?’
\v 50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
\p
\v 51 Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was obedient to them. His mother remembered in her heart all that was said.
\v 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and with people.

\v 1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judaea, Herod was Tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was Tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, Lysanias was Tetrarch of Abilene,
\v 2 and Annas and Caiaphas were the High Priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.
\v 3 He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,
\v 4 as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah who tells of ‘the voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Prepare the highway of the Lord. Make his paths straight.
\v 5 Every valley will be filled up, and every mountain and hill levelled down. What is crooked will be straightened, and the rocks will become smooth roads.
\v 6 All flesh will see the salvation of God.”’\rq Isaiah 40:3-5\rq*
\p
\v 7 To the crowds who went out to be baptised by him he would say, ‘Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Well then, produce fruit worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, “We have a father, Abraham,” for I tell you that from these stones God is able to raise up children for Abraham.
\v 9 Already the axe is in place against the base of the tree, for every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown on the fire.’
\p
\v 10 And the crowds would ask him, ‘What then should we do?’
\p
\v 11 And he replied, telling them, ‘Whoever has two coats should give to the one who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.’
\p
\v 12 Even tax collectors came to be baptised, and they said to him, ‘Teacher, what shall we do?’
\p
\v 13 He told them, ‘Collect no more than is due to you.’
\p
\v 14 Soldiers too would question him, saying, ‘And we, what shall we do?’
\p And to them he said, ‘Do not bring false accusations against anyone, intimidate no one, and be content with your wages.’
\p
\v 15 The people were full of expectation, speculating in their hearts about John, whether perhaps he might be the Christ.
\v 16 John responded by telling everyone, ‘I am indeed baptising you with water, but he who is more powerful than I am is coming. I am not worthy to undo his sandal straps. He will baptise you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.
\v 17 His winnowing shovel is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor completely, gathering the wheat into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.’
\p
\v 18 And indeed, with many other exhortations he would preach the Gospel to the people.
\p
\v 19 Herod the Tetrarch who had been censured by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evils which he, Herod, had committed,
\v 20 added even this on top of everything: he committed John to prison.
\p
\v 21 When all the people had been baptised, and Jesus had been baptised and was praying, heaven opened
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in the bodily appearance of a dove. And a voice came from heaven, saying, ‘You are my Son, the Beloved. In you I delight.’
\p
\v 23 At the beginning, Jesus himself was about thirty years old. He was, as it was supposed, a son of Joseph, from Heli,
\v 24 from Matthan, from Levi, from Melchi, from Joannas, from Joseph,
\v 25 from Mattathias, from Amos, from Nahum, from Eslim, from Naggai,
\v 26 from Maath, from Mattathias, from Semeu, from Josech, from Judah,
\v 27 from Joannas, from Rhesa, from Zorobabel, from Salathiel, from Neri,
\v 28 from Melchi, from Addi, from Kosam, from Elmodam, from Er,
\v 29 from Joses, from Eliezer, from Jorim, from Matthat, from Levi,
\v 30 from Simeon, from Judah, from Joseph, from Jonan, from Eliakim,
\v 31 from Meleas, from Mainan, from Mattatha, from Nathan, from David,
\v 32 from Jesse, from Obed, from Boaz, from Salmon, from Naasson,
\v 33 from Aminadab, from Aram, from Joram, from Esrom, from Phares, from Judah,
\v 34 from Jacob, from Isaac, from Abraham, from Terah, from Nachor,
\v 35 from Seruch, from Ragau, from Phalek, from Eber, from Sala,
\v 36 from Cainan, from Arphaxad, from Shem, from Noah, from Lamech,
\v 37 from Methuselah, from Enoch, from Jared, from Maleleel, from Cainan,
\v 38 from Enos, from Seth, from Adam, from God.
\p

\v 1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness.
\v 2 For forty days he was tempted by the devil and during those days he did not eat anything. Afterwards, when they had come to an end, he was hungry.
\p
\v 3 The devil said to him, ‘If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.’
\p
\v 4 But Jesus answered him, saying, ‘It is written, “No human being shall live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”’\rq Deuteronomy 8:3\rq*
\p
\v 5 Then the devil took him up a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
\v 6 The devil said to him, ‘I shall give you all this power and their glory, for it has been committed to me and I may give it to whom I wish.
\v 7 It will therefore all belong to you if you bow down before me.’
\p
\v 8 But Jesus answered him, saying, ‘Get behind me, Satan. For it is written, “You shall bow down to the Lord your God and you shall worship him alone.”’\rq Deuteronomy 6:13\rq*
\p
\v 9 He then brought him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the Temple. He told him, ‘If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.
\v 10 For it is written, “He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,”
\v 11 and, “They will carry you in their hands so that you do strike your foot against a stone.”’\rq Psalms 90[91]:11-12\rq*
\p
\v 12 But in reply Jesus told him, ‘It has been said, “You shall not tempt the Lord your God.”’\rq Deuteronomy 6:16\rq*
\p
\v 13 When all the temptations had ended, the devil withdrew from him until a favourable time.
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding countryside.
\v 15 He was teaching in their synagogues, honoured by all.
\p
\v 16 Then he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he entered the synagogue as was his custom. He stood up to read,
\v 17 and the scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. Unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it is written,
\v 18 ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim release to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to send the broken away restored,
\v 19 to proclaim the favourable year of the Lord.’\rq Isaiah 61:1-2\rq*
\p
\v 20 After rolling up the scroll and giving it back to the attendant he sat down, and the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him.
\v 21 He began by saying to them, ‘Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.’
\p
\v 22 They were all speaking approvingly of him, marvelling at the gracious words coming from his mouth, and they said, ‘Is this not Joseph’s son?’
\p
\v 23 He said to them, ‘No doubt you will quote this proverb to me: “Physician, heal yourself. Perform here in your home town things that are the equal of those we have heard were done in Capernaum.”’
\v 24 And he said, ‘Truly I tell you that no prophet is acceptable in his home town.
\pi
\v 25 ‘It is a fact, I tell you, that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came upon the whole land,
\v 26 but Elijah was sent to none of them except a widow woman at Zaraphath in Sidon.
\v 27 And there were many lepers in Israel at the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.’
\p
\v 28 When they heard this, everyone in the synagogue was filled with rage.
\v 29 They rose up and threw him out of the town. They marched him to the very edge of the cliff on which their town was built with the intention of throwing him off,
\v 30 but he, passing through the middle of them, walked away.
\p
\v 31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he would teach them every Sabbath.
\v 32 They were amazed by his teaching for his words had authority.
\p
\v 33 In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of a foul demon, and it called out in a loud voice,
\v 34 saying, ‘Leave us alone. What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you! You are the Holy One of God.’
\p
\v 35 Jesus rebuked it, saying, ‘Be silent’ and, ‘Come out of him.’ Then the demon threw him among them and came out of him, having done him no harm.
\p
\v 36 Wonder came upon them, and they were all talking at once, saying to one another, ‘What is this teaching? For with authority and power he commands foul spirits and they come out.’
\v 37 And his renown spread to every corner of the surrounding countryside.
\p
\v 38 Having left the synagogue, he went to Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was laid low by a bad fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf.
\v 39 He therefore stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and attended to them.
\p
\v 40 Then at sunset they were all bringing to him everyone who was ill from various diseases, and laying his hands upon each of them, he healed them.
\v 41 The demons coming out of many were crying out, saying, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of God.’ But he rebuked them, and did not allow them to speak because they knew him to be the Christ.
\p
\v 42 Then at daybreak he set out and went to a deserted place, but the crowds were looking for him, and when they reached him they clung to him so that he might not leave them.
\v 43 He told them, ‘I must preach the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to the other towns as well, for this is why I have been sent.’
\v 44 And he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret with the crowd pressing upon him to hear the word of God
\v 2 when he saw two boats lying by the lakeside, but the fishermen had come ashore and were washing the nets.
\v 3 He got into one of the boats, it was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. Then, sitting down, he taught the crowds from the boat.
\p
\v 4 When he had finished speaking he said to Simon, ‘Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.’
\p
\v 5 And in reply Simon told him, ‘Master, we have toiled all night and have taken nothing. But at your word I shall let down the net.’
\v 6 When they did so, they trapped a great shoal of fish. Their net was breaking,
\v 7 and so they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats to the point that they were sinking.
\p
\v 8 Seeing this, Simon Peter fell at Jesus’ knees saying, ‘Leave me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.’
\v 9 For astonishment had overcome him and all who were with him because of the haul of fish that they had taken;
\v 10 and it was the same with James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
\p Then Jesus said to Simon, ‘Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching living people.’
\v 11 Having brought the boats ashore, they left everything and followed him.
\p
\v 12 When he was in one of the towns, a man full of leprosy appeared. Seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, ‘Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.’
\p
\v 13 He stretched out his hand, touched him and said, ‘I want to. Be clean.’ And immediately the leprosy left him.
\v 14 He ordered him to tell no one, ‘But go on your way, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses directed, as a testimony to them.’
\p
\v 15 Nevertheless, news about him was spreading more and more, and great crowds were gathering to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
\v 16 But he would slip away into the wilderness to pray.
\p
\v 17 One day when he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the Law who had come from every village of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem were sitting there, and the power of the Lord was present to heal.
\v 18 Then some men appeared, carrying on a bed a man who was paralysed. They tried to bring him inside to set him down in front of him,
\v 19 but not finding a way in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his stretcher down through the tiles into the middle, in front of Jesus.
\v 20 When he saw their faith, he said to him, ‘Man, your sins are forgiven you.’
\p
\v 21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to reflect, asking themselves, ‘Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?’
\p
\v 22 Jesus read their thoughts, and in response he said to them, ‘What is troubling your hearts?
\v 23 Which is easier: to say, “Your sins are forgiven you,” or to say, “Stand up and walk”?
\v 24 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins,’ he addressed the paralysed man, ‘I say to you, stand up. Pick up your stretcher and go home.’
\v 25 Immediately he stood up in full view of them, picked up what he had been lying on, and returned to his home, glorifying God.
\v 26 Amazement overtook every one of them. They too were glorifying God and were filled with fear, and they said, ‘We have seen extraordinary things today.’
\p
\v 27 After that he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office. He said to him, ‘Follow me,’
\v 28 and he, leaving everything, got up and followed him.
\p
\v 29 Levi held a great feast for him at his home, and a great number of tax collectors and others were sitting with them at table.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and their scribes were grumbling. They said to his disciples, ‘Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?’
\p
\v 31 Jesus responded, telling them, ‘It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are ill.
\v 32 I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.’
\p
\v 33 They asked him, ‘Why do John’s disciples frequently fast and pray in the same way as those of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?’
\p
\v 34 And he said to them, ‘Can you make the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?
\v 35 But the time will surely come when the bridegroom is taken from them. Then in those days they will fast.’
\p
\v 36 He told them a parable. ‘No one puts a patch of new cloth on old clothing, for if they do, the new will cause a tear; and besides, the new piece will not match the old.
\v 37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, for if they do, the new wine will burst the skins and be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
\v 38 Therefore new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.
\v 39 And those who have drunk the old wine will not immediately have a desire for the new, for they will say that the the old is better.’
\p

\v 1 As he was walking through the cornfields on the first Sabbath after Passover his disciples were plucking the ears, rolling the grain out between their hands, and eating it.
\v 2 Some of the Pharisees asked them, ‘Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?’
\p
\v 3 And in reply Jesus said to them, ‘Have you never read this that David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?
\v 4 How he entered the house of God and took the shewbread and ate it? He even gave to those with him what only the priests are permitted to eat.’
\v 5 And he told them, ‘The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.’
\p
\v 6 Then on another Sabbath it happened that he went into the synagogue to teach, and a man was there whose right hand was withered.
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching whether he would heal on the Sabbath. They were looking for evidence against him.
\v 8 He knew what they were thinking, and he said to the man with the withered hand, ‘Get up and stand out in the middle.’ And he got up and stood there.
\v 9 Jesus then said to them, ‘I shall ask you something. Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill?’
\v 10 After looking around at them all, he said to the man, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ He did so, and his hand was restored like the other.
\v 11 They however were filled with rage and began to discuss among themselves what they might do to Jesus.
\p
\v 12 In those days he went out on the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
\v 13 Then as day broke he called his disciples to him, and he chose twelve from among them whom he called Apostles:
\v 14 Simon whom he also named Peter, and his brother Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon called the Zealot,
\v 16 Judas the son of James and Judas Iscariot who also became the betrayer.
\p
\v 17 He came down with them and stopped at a level place. A crowd of his disciples and a great number from all Judaea, Jerusalem and from the coastal areas of Tyre and Sidon came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,
\v 18 those too who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were healed.
\v 19 The whole crowd was trying to touch him because power was coming from him, and he was healing them all.
\p
\v 20 Then he raised his eyes to his disciples and said,
\q1 ‘Blessed are the poor,
\q2 for yours is the Kingdom of God.
\q1
\v 21 Blessed are those who hunger now,
\q2 for you will be filled.
\q1 Blessed are those who weep now,
\q2 for you will laugh.
\q1
\v 22 Blessed are you when people hate you,
\q2 and when they exclude and revile you
\q2 and drag down your name as evil on account of the Son of Man.
\q1
\v 23 Rejoice on that day and leap for joy,
\q2 for you know that your reward is great in heaven.
\q2 Indeed, their ancestors did the same to the prophets.
\q1
\v 24 But woe to you who are rich,
\q2 for you have received your consolation.
\q1
\v 25 Woe to you who are full,
\q2 for you will go hungry.
\q1 Woe to you who are laughing now,
\q2 for you will grieve and weep.
\q1
\v 26 Woe, when everyone speaks well of you,
\q2 for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.

\pi
\v 27 ‘But I say to you who are listening, love your enemies; do good to those who hate you;
\v 28 bless those who curse you; pray for those who insult you.
\v 29 To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other as well; from the one who takes away your coat, do not withhold even your shirt.
\v 30 Give to everyone who asks of you; and from the one who takes away your possessions, do not demand their return.
\pi
\v 31 ‘Treat others in the same way as you would want them to treat you.
\v 32 But if you love those who love you, where is the credit for you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, where is the credit for you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, where is the credit for you? For even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive as much again.
\v 35 Instead, love your enemies and do good, and lend expecting nothing back. Then your reward will be great and you will be children of the Most High, for he is gracious towards the ungrateful and the evil.
\pi
\v 36 ‘Therefore be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
\v 37 Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.
\v 38 Give, and it will be given to you; they will give into your lap full measure, pressed down and shaken together and overflowing. For with the same measure with which you measure out will it be measured back to you in return.’
\p
\v 39 He told them a parable. ‘Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch?
\v 40 The disciple is not superior to the teacher, but all who are fully taught will be like their teacher.
\v 41 And how is it that you see the speck in your brother or sister’s eye, but do not notice the beam of timber in your own eye?
\v 42 Or how can you say to the other, “Let me remove the speck in your eye” when you cannot see the beam of timber in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck in your brother or sister’s eye.
\pi
\v 43 ‘And there is no good tree that bears rotten fruit, nor a rotten tree that bears good fruit.
\v 44 Indeed, each tree is recognised from its own fruit. You do not gather figs from thorns, nor harvest grapes from a bramble.
\v 45 From the good stored up in the heart, a good person brings out what is good; and from the evil stored up in the heart, the evil person brings out what is evil, because the mouth speaks what overflows from the heart.
\pi
\v 46 ‘Why do you call me, “Lord, Lord!” but do not do what I say?
\v 47 Those who come to me listen to my words and do them. I shall show you what they are like.
\v 48 They are like someone building a house who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. Then a flood came. The water surged against that house, but it was not able to shift it because it had been founded on the rock.
\v 49 And those who listen but do not act are like someone building a house on the soil with no foundation. The water surged against it, and at once it fell; and the damage to that house was enormous.’
\p
\c 7
\v 1 When he had finished saying everything in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.
\p
\v 2 A certain centurion had a highly valued servant who was ill, about to die.
\v 3 Hearing about Jesus, he sent Jewish elders to him, asking him to come and save his servant.
\v 4 They approached Jesus and earnestly appealed to him, saying, ‘You should do this for him because he deserves it,
\v 5 for he loves our nation and built the synagogue for us.’
\p
\v 6 Jesus was on his way with them and was already not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to him to say, ‘Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.
\v 7 For this reason I did not think I was worthy even to appear before you myself, but say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I too am a man under authority and have soldiers under me, and I say to this one, “Go” and he goes, and to another, “Come” and he comes, and to my servant, “Do this” and he does it.’
\p
\v 9 When Jesus heard this he marvelled at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, ‘I tell you that not even in Israel have I found such great faith.’
\v 10 And when they returned to the house, the messengers found the ailing servant in good health.
\p
\v 11 On the following day he was making his way to a town called Nain, and travelling with him were a good number of his disciples and a large crowd.
\v 12 As he approached the town gate he saw a dead man being carried out, his mother’s only son, and she was a widow. Quite a crowd from the town was with her.
\v 13 When the Lord saw her he was moved with compassion for her, and he said to her, ‘Do not weep.’
\v 14 He went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. He said, ‘Young man, I tell you, arise,’
\v 15 and the dead man sat up and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
\p
\v 16 Fear took hold of everyone and they began glorifying God, saying, ‘A great prophet has arisen among us’ and, ‘God has visited his people.’
\v 17 And this report about him spread throughout the whole of Judaea and all the surrounding region.
\p
\v 18 John’s disciples told him all about these things.
\v 19 Then summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to Jesus to ask, ‘Are you the one who is coming, or are we to look for someone else?’
\p
\v 20 When they reached him, the men said, ‘John the Baptiser has sent us to you to ask, “Are you the one who is coming, or are we to look for someone else?”’
\p
\v 21 Having healed many from diseases and scourges and evil spirits at that time, and given sight to many who were blind,
\v 22 Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘Go on your way and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor hear the Gospel preached,
\v 23 and blessed are those who are not offended by me.’
\p
\v 24 When John’s disciples had left, he began to speak to the crowds about John. ‘What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 25 No? What did you go out to see? A man dressed in elegant clothing? Surely those in gorgeous clothes and living in luxury are in royal palaces.
\v 26 Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, and I tell you much more than a prophet.
\v 27 This is he of whom it is written, “Understand that I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way before you.”\rq Malachi 3:1\rq*
\v 28 For I tell you that among those born of women there never was a prophet greater than John the Baptiser, and yet the least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.’
\p
\v 29 And hearing this, all the people and the tax collectors who had been baptised with John’s baptism acknowledged God as righteous;
\v 30 but the Pharisees and the lawyers, not having been baptised by him, rejected God’s purpose for themselves.
\p
\v 31 ‘With what then am I to compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
\v 32 They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling out to one another and saying, “We piped for you and you did not dance. We sang a lament for you and you did not weep.”
\v 33 For John the Baptiser has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, “He has a demon.”
\v 34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, “Look at the man: a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.”
\v 35 Yet Wisdom is vindicated by all her children.’
\p
\v 36 One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and so he went into the Pharisee’s house and sat at the table.
\v 37 Then a woman of the town appeared; she was a sinner. When she learnt that he was dining at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil.
\v 38 Taking up a position behind, near his feet, she wept aloud and began to bathe his feet with the tears and to wipe them with the hair of her head. She was kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfumed oil.
\p
\v 39 When the Pharisee who invited him saw this he said to himself, ‘If this man were a prophet he would know who, and what sort of woman, is touching him: that she is a sinner.’
\p
\v 40 Then Jesus spoke. He said to him, ‘Simon, I have something to tell you.’
\p He said, ‘Speak, teacher.’
\p
\v 41 ‘There were two debtors of a certain money-lender. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty,
\v 42 and as they had nothing with which to repay it, he absolved them both. Which of them then, would you say, will love him more?’
\p
\v 43 And in reply Simon said, ‘The one for whom he wrote off the greater amount I presume.’
\p He told him, ‘You have judged rightly.’
\v 44 And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, ‘Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but this woman has bathed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.
\v 45 You gave me no kiss, but since she arrived this woman has not stopped kissing my feet.
\v 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with perfumed oil.
\v 47 On account of this I tell you that her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she has shown great love. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little.’
\v 48 And he said to her, ‘Your sins are forgiven.’
\p
\v 49 Then those dining with him began to say to themselves, ‘Who is this who even forgives sins?’
\p
\v 50 He said to the woman, ‘Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.’
\p
\c 8
\v 1 After that he moved on by town and village, preaching and proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,
\v 2 and some of the women who had been healed of diseases and scourges and evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene from whom seven demons had come out,
\v 3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who were ministering to him from their resources.
\v 4 A large crowd was gathering as those from town after town made their way to him.
\p He told a parable.
\v 5 ‘The sower went out to sow his seed, and as he was sowing, some fell by the wayside, and it was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up.
\v 6 And some fell on rock, and when it germinated it withered away because it had no moisture.
\v 7 And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it.
\v 8 And some fell into good soil, and it grew and bore fruit a hundred times over.’ Saying this, he exclaimed, ‘Let those who have ears for listening, listen.’
\p
\v 9 His disciples questioned him, asking, ‘What does this parable mean?’
\p
\v 10 And he replied, ‘To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but for everyone else it is in parables so that when they look they may not see, and when they hear they may not understand.
\p
\v 11 Now this is the parable. The seed is the word of God.
\v 12 Those by the wayside are the ones who hear, then the devil comes and carries off the word from their heart so that they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 Those on rock are the ones who, when they hear, accept the word with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but at a time of temptation they fall away.
\v 14 That which fell into the thorns are those who hear; then, going away, they are choked by the cares and possessions and pleasures of life, and do not bear mature fruit.
\v 15 That in the good soil are those who, when they hear the word, keep hold of it in an honest and good heart, and they bear fruit which endures.
\pi
\v 16 ‘No one who has lit a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but places it on a stand so that those coming in may see the light.
\v 17 And there is nothing hidden that will not become visible, nothing secret that will not be made known and revealed.
\v 18 Pay attention then to what you are hearing, because those who have will receive, but for those who do not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.’
\p
\v 19 His mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.
\v 20 It was reported to him. They said, ‘Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.’
\p
\v 21 But in reply he said to them, ‘My mother and my brothers? They are the ones who listen to the word of God and do it.’
\p
\v 22 Then one day he got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, ‘Let us go over to the far side of the lake.’ And so they cast off.
\p
\v 23 As they were sailing, he fell asleep. Then a gale came down upon the lake, and they were being swamped and were in danger.
\v 24 His disciples came to him and woke him, saying, ‘Master, master, we are perishing!’
\p He woke up and rebuked the wind and the water’s raging; they ceased and it became calm.
\v 25 He said to them, ‘Where is your faith?’
\p And they were afraid and marvelled, saying to one another, ‘Who then is this who gives orders even to the winds and to the water, and they obey him?’
\p
\v 26 He landed on the Gadarene coast which is opposite Galilee
\v 27 and, on coming ashore, a man from the town met him. He had demons of long standing and was wearing no clothes, nor did he live in a house, but among the tombs.
\v 28 Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him. In a mighty voice he said, ‘What am I to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me,’
\v 29 for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had taken hold of him; and he was being guarded, bound with manacles and fetters, but he would break the shackles apart and be driven by the demons into the wilderness.
\p
\v 30 Jesus questioned him, asking, ‘What is your name?’
\p He replied, ‘Legion,’ because many demons had entered into him,
\v 31 and he begged him not to order them to go into the abyss.
\p
\v 32 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding on the hillside, and they begged him to allow them to go into these; and he gave them permission.
\v 33 And so, coming out of the man, the demons entered the pigs and the herd rushed over the cliff into the lake and were drowned.
\v 34 Then when they saw what had happened, the herdsmen fled. They carried the news to town and country,
\v 35 and the people came out to see what had happened.
\p When they reached Jesus they found the man from whom the demons had departed clothed and sane at Jesus’ feet, and they were afraid.
\v 36 Those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been delivered.
\v 37 Then the whole crowd of people from the surrounding Gadarene countryside asked him to leave them, because they were overcome with a great fear. And he went back and got into the boat.
\v 38 The man from whom the demons had departed pleaded with him, that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\v 39 ‘Return home and tell them what great things God has done for you.’ And he went back, proclaiming throughout the whole town what great things Jesus had done for him.
\p
\v 40 On Jesus’ return, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all watching for him.
\v 41 Then a man named Jairus arrived, a ruler of the synagogue. Falling at Jesus’ feet, he begged him to come to his house
\v 42 because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying.
\p As he was setting off, the crowds were pressing against him.
\v 43 And there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years, who had spent on physicians all she had to live on but could not be healed by any of them.
\v 44 She came up to him from behind and touched the hem of his cloak, and instantly her flow of blood stopped.
\v 45 Jesus said, ‘Who touched me?’ But everyone denied it.
\p Peter and those with him said, ‘Master, the crowds are crushing you and pressing in on all sides, and you ask, “Who touched me?”’
\p
\v 46 Jesus said, ‘Someone did touch me, for I know that power has gone out from me.’
\p
\v 47 Then the woman, realising that she had not escaped notice, came, trembling, and fell down before him. In the presence of all the people she revealed to him the reason she touched him, and how she was instantly healed.
\v 48 He said to her, ‘Have courage, daughter. Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.’
\p
\v 49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue ruler’s house to say to him, ‘Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher.’
\p
\v 50 But Jesus heard and responded, telling him, ‘Do not be afraid. Only believe, and she will be saved.’
\p
\v 51 When he arrived at the house, he allowed no one to enter except Peter and John and James and the father and mother of the child.
\v 52 Everyone was wailing and lamenting her, but he said, ‘Do not wail. She has not died but is sleeping.’
\v 53 But they laughed at him, knowing that she had died.
\v 54 He sent them out. Then taking hold of her hand he called out, saying, ‘Child, arise.’
\v 55 Her spirit returned, and at once she got up; and he directed that something should be given to her to eat.
\v 56 Her parents were astounded, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 Calling together his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
\v 2 He then sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick,
\v 3 and he said to them, ‘Take nothing for the journey: no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no second shirt.
\v 4 Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.
\v 5 As for those who do not welcome you, when you leave that town shake even the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.’
\v 6 They set out, passing through village after village, preaching and healing everywhere.
\p
\v 7 Herod the Tetrarch heard about everything that was being done by him, and he was perplexed because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
\v 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some prophet from long ago had risen.
\v 9 But Herod said, ‘John I have beheaded. Who then is this about whom I am hearing such things?’ And he wanted to see him.
\p
\v 10 When the Apostles returned, they reported to him what great things they had done. Then he took them, and withdrew privately to a deserted place near a town called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But the crowds found out and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those in need of healing.
\p
\v 12 When the day began to wane, the Twelve came up and said to him, ‘Send the crowd away so that they may make their way to the villages and farms round about to lodge and to find food, for we are in a lonely place here.’
\p
\v 13 But he told them, ‘You give them something to eat.’
\p And they replied, ‘We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we are to go to buy food for all these people.’
\v 14 For there were about five thousand men.
\p Then he told his disciples, ‘Make them sit down in companies, fifty in each.’
\v 15 And they did so: they made them all sit down.
\v 16 Then taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
\v 17 They ate and all were satisfied, and twelve baskets of their left over broken pieces were collected.
\p
\v 18 Once, when he was praying alone and the disciples were with him, he questioned them, asking, ‘Who do the crowds say that I am?’
\p
\v 19 In reply they said, ‘John the Baptiser, and others Elijah, and others that some prophet from long ago has risen.’
\p
\v 20 He said to them, ‘And you, who do you say that I am?’
\p Peter answered. He said, ‘The Christ of God.’
\p
\v 21 And he charged them, insisting that they tell this to no one,
\v 22 saying, ‘The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed; and be raised on the third day.’
\p
\v 23 He said to them all, ‘Those who want to come after me, let them disown themselves, take up their cross day by day and follow me.
\v 24 For those who want to save their life will lose it, but those who lose their life for my sake will save it.
\v 25 For how do they profit by gaining the whole world but losing, or forfeiting, themselves?
\v 26 Because those who are ashamed of me and of my words, of them the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels.
\v 27 I tell you truly that some of those standing here will not taste death until they see the Kingdom of God.’
\p
\v 28 About eight days after saying these things, he took Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to pray.
\v 29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was changed and his clothing became dazzlingly white.
\v 30 Then they saw two men talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah
\v 31 who had appeared in glory, and they were speaking of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 32 Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, but becoming wide awake they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
\v 33 Then, as they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, ‘Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters: one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah,’ not realising what he was saying.
\v 34 As he said this, a cloud came and overshadowed them and they became fearful as they entered the cloud.
\p
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, ‘This is my Son, the Beloved. Listen to him.’
\v 36 And when the voice had passed, Jesus was found alone. They fell silent and told no one at that time anything of what they had seen.
\p
\v 37 On the next day when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.
\v 38 There was a man in the crowd who shouted out, saying, ‘Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
\v 39 A spirit, you see, will seize him and he will suddenly cry out. It convulses him and he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and it is destroying him.
\v 40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.’
\p
\v 41 And in reply Jesus said, ‘Faithless and perverse generation. How long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.’
\v 42 As the boy was coming forward, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
\v 43 And they were all amazed at the majesty of God.
\p As they were all marvelling at everything that Jesus had done, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 ‘Bend your ears to these words, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into human hands.’
\v 45 But they did not understand what was being said; it was hidden from them so that they should not understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about this matter.
\p
\v 46 A dispute arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
\v 47 And Jesus, seeing what they were thinking in their hearts, caught up a small child, stood him at his side
\v 48 and said to them, ‘Whoever welcomes this infant in my name, welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me, welcomes him who sent me. Truly, it is the least among you all who is the great one.’
\p
\v 49 Then John spoke up. He said, ‘Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he is not a follower with us.’
\p
\v 50 But Jesus told him, ‘Do not forbid him because he is not with us, for those who are not against us are for us.’
\p
\v 51 Now when the time came for him to be taken up, he set his face to travel on to Jerusalem.
\v 52 He sent messengers ahead of him, and on their way they entered a Samaritan village to make ready for him.
\v 53 But they would not welcome him because his face was turned towards Jerusalem.
\v 54 When his disciples James and John appeared, they said, ‘Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did?’
\p
\v 55 He turned and rebuked them, saying, ‘You have no notion of what is inspiring you.
\v 56 The Son of Man did not come to destroy people’s lives but to save them.’ And they travelled on to another village.
\p
\v 57 As they went on their way, someone said to him, ‘I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.’
\p
\v 58 Jesus told him, ‘Foxes have dens and the birds of the air have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’
\p
\v 59 He said to another, ‘Follow me.’
\p But he said, ‘Lord, first let me go and bury my father.’
\p
\v 60 And Jesus replied, ‘Let the dead bury their own dead. As for you, go and proclaim the Kingdom of God.’
\p
\v 61 Yet another said, ‘I want to follow you, Lord, but first let me say farewell to those at home.’
\p
\v 62 Jesus told him, ‘No one who has put a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.’
\p
\c 10
\v 1 After this the Lord also appointed seventy others, and he sent them in pairs on ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.
\v 2 He told them, ‘The harvest is indeed plentiful but the labourers few, so pray to the Lord of the harvest that he may send out labourers into his harvest.
\p
\v 3 Go on your way. Listen, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
\v 4 Take no purse, no bag, no sandals, and greet no one on the road.
\v 5 Whatever house you enter, first say, “Peace to this house,”
\v 6 and if a person of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 Remain in that house, eating and drinking what they have, for the labourer is worth his wages. Do not go from house to house.
\p
\v 8 And whatever town you enter where they welcome you, eat what is set before you
\v 9 and heal those in it who are ill, and tell them, “The Kingdom of God has come close to you.”
\v 10 But whatever town you enter where they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say,
\v 11 “Even the dust of your town on our feet that clings to us, we brush off against you. But understand this: the Kingdom of God has come near to you.”
\v 12 I tell you that it will be more tolerable on that Day for Sodom than for that town.
\pi
\v 13 ‘Woe to you, Chorazin. Woe to you, Bethsaida. For if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 At the judgement it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
\v 15 And you, Capernaum, exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades.
\v 16 Whoever listens to you, listens to me; and whoever rejects you, rejects me; and whoever rejects me, rejects him who sent me.’
\p
\v 17 The seventy returned with joy, saying, ‘Lord, even the demons are obedient to us in your name.’
\p
\v 18 And he told them, ‘I was watching Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
\v 19 Listen, I am giving you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy so that nothing may harm you.
\v 20 Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits obey you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.’
\p
\v 21 At that moment Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and sensible and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this was your delight.’
\p
\v 22 Then turning to the disciples, he said, ‘Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father; nor who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.’
\p
\v 23 Turning again to the disciples, he said privately, ‘Blessed are the eyes that see what you are seeing,
\v 24 for I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you are seeing, but they did not see it; and to hear what you are hearing, but they did not hear it.’
\p
\v 25 Then one of the lawyers stood up, testing him, asking, ‘Teacher, what have I to do so that I shall inherit everlasting life?’
\p
\v 26 He said to him, ‘What is written in the Law? How do you read it?’
\p
\v 27 Answering, he said, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself.’
\p
\v 28 He told him, ‘You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.’
\p
\v 29 But he, wanting to put himself in the right, asked Jesus, ‘And who is my neighbour?’
\p
\v 30 Responding, Jesus said, ‘A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell foul of robbers. They stripped him, wounded him, and went away leaving him half dead.
\v 31 By coincidence, there was priest going down by that road. When he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.
\v 32 In the same way a Levite also happened upon the place. He came and looked, and passed by on the opposite side.
\v 33 Then a travelling Samaritan came across him. When he saw him he was moved with compassion.
\v 34 He came up and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Lifting him on to his own animal, he brought him to an inn and took care of him.
\v 35 And when he left in the morning he took out two denarii which he gave to the innkeeper, telling him, “Take care of him. And whatever you spend in addition, I shall repay you when I return.”
\v 36 Now which of these three, do you think, became a neighbour to the one who fell foul of the robbers?’
\p
\v 37 He replied, ‘The one who showed mercy to him.’
\p And Jesus told him, ‘Go and do the same.’
\p
\v 38 As they were travelling along, he entered a village and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
\v 39 She had a sister called Mary who sat at Jesus’ feet and listened to what he said.
\v 40 Martha however was distracted with much serving. She came up to him and said, ‘Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Then speak to her so that she may help me.’
\p
\v 41 But in reply Jesus told her, ‘Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.
\v 42 Only one thing is needed and Mary has made the right choice. It shall not be taken from her.’
\p
\c 11
\v 1 He was praying in a certain place, and when he had finished one of his disciples said to him, ‘Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.’
\p
\v 2 And he told them, ‘When you pray say,
\q1 “Our Father who is in heaven,
\q2 may your name be holy.
\q1 Your Kingdom come, your will be done,
\q2 on the earth as it is in heaven.
\q1
\v 3 Give us our bread each day,
\q2 sufficient for the day.
\q1
\v 4 And forgive us our sins,
\q2 as we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us.
\q1 And do not lead us into temptation,
\q2 but deliver us from the evil one.”’
\m
\p
\v 5 Then he said to them, ‘Who among you, who has a friend, would go to him at midnight and say to him, “Friend, lend me three loaves
\v 6 because a friend of mine has stopped off at my house and I have nothing to set before him.”
\pi
\v 7 ‘And he, answering from inside, may say, “Do not disturb me. The door is now locked, and I and my children are in bed. I cannot get up to provide for you.”
\v 8 I tell you, even if he will not get up and provide for him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
\v 9 And so I tell you, ask and it will be given to you, search and you will find, knock and it will be opened for you.
\v 10 For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who searches, finds; and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.
\pi
\v 11 ‘And which father among you, if a son asks for a loaf, would offer him a stone? Or if it is a fish, would offer him a snake instead of a fish?
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg, would offer him a scorpion?
\v 13 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the good Spirit to those who ask him.’
\p
\v 14 He was casting out a demon that was mute, and when the demon had gone, the man without speech spoke, and the crowds were amazed.
\v 15 But some of them said, ‘It is by Beelzeboul, the prince of the demons, that he casts out demons.’
\v 16 And others, as a test, demanded from him a sign from heaven.
\p
\v 17 He knew what they were thinking, and he told them, ‘Every kingdom that is divided within itself is brought to ruin as house falls upon house;
\v 18 so if Satan is also divided within himself, how will his kingdom remain standing if, as you say, I cast out demons by Beelzeboul?
\v 19 If I am casting out demons by Beelzeboul, by whom are your own people casting them out? In this matter they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
\pi
\v 21 ‘When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own estate, what he has is safe.
\v 22 But when someone stronger than he attacks and overpowers him, he takes away all his armour on which he had relied and divides up his spoils.
\pi
\v 23 ‘The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me, scatters.
\pi
\v 24 ‘When an unclean spirit leaves a person it wanders through arid places looking for rest, but finding none, it says, “I shall return to my home from which I came,”
\v 25 and when it arrives it finds it swept and tidy.
\v 26 It then goes off and invites seven other spirits, more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so that the last state of that person is worse than the first.’
\p
\v 27 As he was saying these things, a woman called out from the crowd, saying to him, ‘Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you.’
\p
\v 28 And he replied, ‘Yes, and more than that. Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it.’
\p
\v 29 With the crowds gathering, he began to say, ‘This generation is an evil generation. It looks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
\v 30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so too the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.
\v 31 The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgement with the men of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and what you see here is greater than Solomon.
\v 32 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and what you see here is greater than Jonah.
\pi
\v 33 ‘No one lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a measuring tub, but on a lamp stand so that those entering may see the light.
\v 34 The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is clear, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is diseased, your body is benighted as well.
\v 35 Take care then that the light in you is not darkness.
\v 36 But if your whole body is full of light with no part in darkness, there will be complete brightness as when a lamp by shining gives you light.’
\p
\v 37 While he was saying this to him, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And going in, he sat down.
\v 38 The Pharisee was astonished to see that before the meal he did not first perform the ritual ablutions\f +\fr 11:38\ft Literally ‘baptised himself’.\f*.
\v 39 But the Lord said to him, ‘You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but your inside is full of extortion and iniquity.
\v 40 Have you no sense? Has the one who made the outside not also made the inside?
\v 41 As for what is within, give alms; then, you see, everything will be clean for you.
\v 42 But woe to you Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every herb but neglect justice and the love of God. It is these things you ought to be doing while not giving up on those others.
\v 43 Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
\v 44 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you are like the unmarked graves of which the people walking above are unaware.’
\p
\v 45 One of the lawyers responded, saying to him, ‘Teacher, by saying these things you are also insulting us.’
\p
\v 46 But he replied, ‘Woe to you lawyers as well, because you load people with burdens onerous to carry: burdens which you yourselves will not touch, even with one of your fingers.
\v 47 Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, when it was your ancestors who killed them.
\v 48 It is indeed the case that you acknowledge and celebrate the actions of your ancestors, even though they killed them; and then you build their tombs.
\v 49 Surely the reason why God’s wisdom has declared, “I shall send them prophets and apostles and some of them they will kill and persecute,”
\v 50 is so that the blood of all the prophets that has been spilt since the foundation of the world may be required of this generation:
\v 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the building. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
\v 52 Woe to you lawyers, because you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves have not entered, and you would obstruct those who are entering.’
\p
\v 53 As he was telling them these things, the scribes and Pharisees began furiously to confront and interrogate him about many matters,
\v 54 ambushing him, trying to catch something from his lips with which they could accuse him.
\p
\c 12
\v 1 Meanwhile, as a crowd of countless thousands came together, even trampling upon each other, he began to speak to his disciples.
\p ‘Above all, guard yourselves from the yeast, that is, the hypocrisy of the Pharisees.
\v 2 There is nothing that has been concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not become known;
\v 3 for whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken into the ear in closed rooms will be published from the housetops.
\pi
\v 4 ‘I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and beyond that can do no more.
\v 5 I shall show you whom you should fear: fear the one who, after killing, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, that is the one you should fear.
\pi
\v 6 ‘Are not five sparrows sold for twopence\f +\fr 12:6\ft ‘two assarii’ – An assarius, or as, was a small coin with a value of 1/16th of a denarius.\f*? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.
\v 7 And even the hairs of your head have all been counted, so do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.
\pi
\v 8 ‘I tell you that everyone who has acknowledged me in the presence of others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge in the presence of the angels of God.
\v 9 But those who have disowned me in the presence of others will be disowned in the presence of the angels of God.
\v 10 If anyone should utter a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven. But those who have blasphemed against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 11 When they haul you before the synagogues or the rulers or the authorities, do not be anxious about how or with what to defend yourselves, or what you should say,
\v 12 for at that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you must say.’
\p
\v 13 Someone from the crowd said to him, ‘Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.’
\p
\v 14 But he told him, ‘Man, who appointed me judge and arbitrator over you?’
\v 15 He said to them, ‘Watch out and beware of all greediness, because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of one’s possessions.’
\p
\v 16 Then he told them a parable. He said, ‘The land of a certain rich man yielded abundantly.
\v 17 He thought to himself, “What shall I do? I have no room to store my produce.”
\v 18 Then he said, “This is what I shall do: I shall pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I shall gather all my crops and my goods;
\v 19 and I shall say to my soul, ‘Soul, you have many good things stored away for many years. Take your ease. Eat, drink, and be merry!’”
\pi
\v 20 ‘But God said to him, “You fool. Tonight your life will be reclaimed from you. And these things which you have prepared, to whom will they belong?”
\pi
\v 21 ‘This is how it is with those who amass wealth for themselves but are not rich towards God.’
\p
\v 22 He said to his disciples, ‘That is why I am telling you not to be anxious about your life: what you are to eat; or about your body: what you are to wear.
\v 23 No, life is more than food and the body more than clothing.
\v 24 Consider the ravens. They do not sow or reap or have a storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. You are of far more value than the birds.
\v 25 Who among you by worrying can add one moment\f +\fr 12:25\ft ‘one cubit’, i.e. the length of the forearm.\f* to your life?
\v 26 If then the smallest thing is not possible for you, why are you anxious about the rest?
\v 27 Consider the lilies. How do they grow? They do not work nor do they spin, yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was as well dressed as one of these.
\v 28 And if that is how God clothes the hay of the meadow, which is here today and thrown into the clay oven tomorrow, how much more you, you of little faith.
\pi
\v 29 ‘Do not set your sights on what you should eat or what you should drink. And be in no doubt
\v 30 that although the peoples of the world set their sights on all these things, your Father knows that you need them.
\v 31 Instead, set your sights on the Kingdom of God, and all these things will be yours as well.
\v 32 Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the Kingdom.
\v 33 Sell your possessions and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure-house in the heavens which no thief goes near, no moth destroys.
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\pi
\v 35 ‘Let your belt be fastened, the lamps be lit.
\v 36 And be like people waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding festivities, so that immediately he arrives and knocks they may open up for him.
\v 37 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds keeping watch when he comes. Truly I tell you that he will fasten his belt, seat them at the table, and come forward to serve them.
\v 38 If he should arrive in the second watch, or it may be the third watch, and find it so, blessed are those servants.
\v 39 But be aware of this, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and not allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 40 You too are to be prepared, for the Son of Man is coming at a time you do not expect.’
\p
\v 41 Peter said to him, ‘Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for everyone?’
\p
\v 42 The Lord replied, ‘Is it not the one who is the faithful and prudent steward whom the master sets over his household to give out the rations at the proper time?
\v 43 Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing just that when he comes.
\v 44 Truly I tell you, he will set him over all his possessions.
\pi
\v 45 ‘But what if the servant says in his heart, “My master is taking his time in returning,” and he begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and to drink and to get drunk?
\v 46 That servant’s master will arrive on a day when he is not expected, and at an unknown time, and he will cut him up and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
\v 47 That servant, who knew his master’s wishes yet did not make preparations nor do what he wanted, will be beaten severely.
\v 48 But the one who, unknowingly, has done things which deserve a flogging, will receive a lesser beating. From everyone to whom much has been given much will be required, and from those to whom much has been entrusted far more will be demanded.
\pi
\v 49 ‘I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already ablaze.
\v 50 But I have a baptism with which to be baptised, and how constrained I am until it is accomplished.
\v 51 Do you think that I have come to bestow peace upon earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on there will be five in one divided house, three against two and two against three.
\v 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.’
\p
\v 54 He also said to the crowds, ‘When you see a cloud rising in the west you say at once, “A shower is coming,” and so it is.
\v 55 And when a southerly wind blows you say that it will be hot, and it is.
\v 56 Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance the sky and of the earth; how is it that you do not discern this moment in time?
\pi
\v 57 ‘And why too do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
\v 58 Even as you are with your adversary on the road, on your way to the magistrate, do your best to be released from him for fear he should drag you before the judge, and the judge should deliver you to the officer for the officer to throw you into prison.
\v 59 I tell you, you will not get out of there until you have paid back the very last penny.’
\p
\c 13
\v 1 At that time some of those present told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices,
\v 2 and Jesus responded by saying, ‘Do you think that these Galileans were the most sinful of all Galileans because they suffered such things?
\v 3 No. But I tell you that unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.
\v 4 Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were the worst transgressors of all the inhabitants of Jerusalem?
\v 5 No. But I tell you that unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.’
\p
\v 6 Then he told this parable. ‘There was a man who had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but he found none.
\v 7 He said to the vine-dresser, “For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and have found none. Cut it down. Why should it use land to no purpose?”
\pi
\v 8 ‘In reply, he said to him, “Master, leave it for this year also while I dig around it and put on manure.
\v 9 It may bear fruit; but if not, then cut it down.”’
\p
\v 10 He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath
\v 11 when a woman appeared. She had a spirit that had made her infirm for eighteen years; she was bent right over and completely unable to straighten up.
\v 12 When Jesus saw her he called her forward and said to her, ‘Woman, you have been freed from your infirmity.’
\v 13 Then he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was straightened up and glorified God.
\p
\v 14 But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, responded by saying to the congregation, ‘There are six days on which we should work. Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath.’
\p
\v 15 The Lord answered him and said, ‘Hypocrites! Does not each of you untie his ox or his donkey from its stall on the Sabbath and lead it off to water it?
\v 16 And this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound for, just imagine, eighteen years! Should she not be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?’
\p
\v 17 As he said this, all his adversaries were put to shame and the whole congregation rejoiced over all the glorious things that were being done by him.
\p
\v 18 He said, ‘What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?
\v 19 It is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his own garden. It grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches.’
\p
\v 20 Again he said, ‘To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
\v 21 It is like yeast which a woman took and blended into three tubs\f + \fr 13:21 \ft ‘three sata’ – 1 saton = 3 gallons approx.\f* of flour until it was all leavened.’
\p
\v 22 He was travelling through towns and villages, teaching and making his way towards Jerusalem.
\v 23 Someone asked him, ‘Lord, are those who are saved, few?’
\p He said to them,
\v 24 ‘Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for I say to you that many will try to enter but will not be able.
\v 25 After the master of the house has got up and shut the door you will be standing outside, knocking on the door and saying, “Lord, Lord, open up for us.” But he will answer and tell you, “I do not know you, or where you are from.”
\v 26 Then you will begin to say, “We ate and drank in your company, and you taught in our marketplaces…”
\v 27 But he will reply, “I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Leave me, all you workers of iniquity.”
\pi
\v 28 ‘In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrust outside.
\v 29 Then they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and sit down in the Kingdom of God,
\v 30 for it is the last who will be first, and the first who will be last.’
\p
\v 31 On that day some Pharisees came up, saying to him, ‘Leave, and get away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.’
\p
\v 32 But he told them, ‘Go and say to that fox, “You see me casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am to be fulfilled.”
\v 33 Nevertheless, today and tomorrow and the day after I must travel on, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside Jerusalem.
\pi
\v 34 ‘Jerusalem, Jerusalem! She who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her. How often have I longed to gather up your children as a hen with her brood under the wing, but you were not willing.
\v 35 You see your house being abandoned, deserted. I tell you that you will not see me until the time comes when you say, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”’
\p
\c 14
\v 1 As he was going into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to dine on the Sabbath, they were watching him.
\v 2 Then a man with oedema appeared in front of him.
\v 3 Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, asking, ‘Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?’
\v 4 When they remained silent, he took hold of him and healed him and sent him away.
\v 5 He asked them, ‘If an animal\f +\fr 14:5 \ft The Greek is ‘son’, but the word is also used of domestic animals.\f*, say an ox, were to fall into a well on a Sabbath day, who among you would not pull it out immediately?’
\v 6 And to this they could give him no answer.
\p
\v 7 When he saw that they were choosing the best seats, he told a parable to those who had been invited. He said to them,
\v 8 ‘When you are invited by someone to a wedding, do not sit in the best seat in case he has invited someone more important than you.
\v 9 When he arrives, the one who invited you both will tell you, “Give the place to this person.” Then, in embarrassment, you will make your way to the lowliest place.
\v 10 Instead, when you are invited go and sit in the lowest place so that when your host comes he may say to you, “Friend, move up higher.” Then you will be honoured in the presence of those sitting with you.
\v 11 For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.’
\p
\v 12 He also said to the one who had invited him, ‘When you give a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers and sisters or your relatives or your rich neighbours, because they will invite you back and you will be repaid.
\v 13 Instead, when you have a party, invite the poor, the disabled, the infirm, the blind,
\v 14 and you will be blessed because they do not have the means to repay you; but you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.’
\p
\v 15 Hearing this, someone with him at the table said to him, ‘Blessed are those who are to dine in the Kingdom of God.’
\p
\v 16 He told him, ‘There was a man who held a great feast and invited many.
\v 17 And at supper time he sent his servant to tell those invited, “Come, because everything is now ready.”
\v 18 But as one, they all asked to be excused.
\pi ‘The first told him, “I have bought a field and I need to go out and see it. I beg you to accept my apologies.”
\pi
\v 19 ‘And another said, “I have bought five yoke of oxen and I am going off to try them out. I beg you to accept my apologies.”
\pi
\v 20 ‘And another said, “I have married a wife, and that is why I cannot come.”
\pi
\v 21 ‘When that servant came in and reported this to his master, the enraged householder told his servant, “Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city and bring in here the poor, the disabled, the infirm and the blind.”
\pi
\v 22 ‘And the servant said, “Lord, it has been done as you commanded, and still there is room.”
\pi
\v 23 ‘Then the master told the servant, “Go out into the roads and hedgerows, and make them come in so that my house may be filled.
\v 24 For I tell you that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.”’
\p
\v 25 Great crowds were travelling with him, and he turned and said to them,
\v 26 ‘Those who come to me and do not hate their own father and mother, spouse and children, brothers and sisters, and even their own life, cannot be my disciples.
\v 27 And those who do not take up their own cross and follow me, cannot be my disciples.
\pi
\v 28 ‘Who among you, wanting to build a tower, would not first sit down and count the cost to see if you have enough to complete it?
\v 29 Otherwise, having laid a foundation and not being able to finish it, everyone looking on will start mocking you,
\v 30 saying, “This person started to build, then could not complete it.”
\pi
\v 31 ‘Or what king going out to engage another king in battle, would not first sit down and consider whether, with ten thousand, he is able to meet the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?
\v 32 And if not, while the other is still far away he sends emissaries to ask for conditions of peace.
\pi
\v 33 ‘In the same way, all those who do not renounce everything they have, cannot be my disciples.
\v 34 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes tasteless with what is it to be seasoned?
\v 35 Being fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap, they will throw it out. Let those who have ears for listening, listen.’
\p
\c 15
\v 1 All the tax collectors and the sinners were coming up to him to listen to him,
\v 2 but the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling, saying, ‘This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.’
\p
\v 3 He told them this parable. He said,
\v 4 ‘What man among you who has a hundred sheep and loses one of them will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?
\v 5 Then, having found it, he joyfully sets it on his shoulders,
\v 6 and on arriving home he calls together friends and neighbours, telling them, “Rejoice with me because I have found my sheep, the one that was lost.”
\v 7 In the same way, I tell you, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, rather than over ninety-nine righteous who do not need repentance.
\pi
\v 8 ‘Or what woman who has ten silver pieces, if she loses one silver piece, will not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
\v 9 Then, having found it, she calls together friends and neighbours, saying, “Rejoice with me because I have found the piece that I lost.”
\v 10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.’
\p
\v 11 He said, ‘There was a man who had two sons,
\v 12 and the younger of them said to the father, “Father, give me the share of the property which falls to me.” And he divided the estate\f +\fr 15:12\ft Literally ‘life’ – i.e. living, or livelihood.\f* between them.
\pi
\v 13 ‘Not many days later the younger son gathered everything together and went on his travels to a distant country, and there he squandered his property with riotous living.
\v 14 When he had spent everything a terrible famine occurred in that country, and he himself began to be in need.
\v 15 He went and bound himself to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.
\v 16 He longed to fill his stomach with the husks that the pigs were eating but no one would give him anything.
\v 17 When he came to himself he said, “How many of those employed by my father have more than enough bread while I am dying of hunger?
\v 18 I shall set out and go to my father, and I shall say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; consider me as one of your workers.”
\pi
\v 20 ‘And so he set off and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was moved with compassion. He came running, and fell on his neck and kissed him.
\v 21 The son said to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and I am no longer worthy to be called your son.”
\pi
\v 22 ‘But the father said to his servants, “Bring out the best robe and put it on him. Give him a ring for his hand and shoes for his feet.
\v 23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and be glad.
\v 24 Because my son here was dead, and he is alive again; he was lost, and he has been found.” And they began to celebrate.
\pi
\v 25 ‘Now his elder son was in the fields, and as he returned, nearing the house, he heard music and dancing.
\v 26 Calling one of the menservants, he asked what was happening,
\v 27 and he told him, “Your brother has arrived and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.”
\pi
\v 28 ‘He was angry and would not go in, and so his father came out and pleaded with him.
\v 29 But in reply to the father he said, “You know that for many years I have served you and never disobeyed your orders, yet not once have you given me a goat so that I might celebrate with my friends.
\v 30 But when your son arrived, this person who has swallowed up your livelihood on prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.”
\pi
\v 31 ‘He said to him, “Child, you are always with me and all that is mine is yours.
\v 32 But it was right to celebrate and be glad because this, your brother, was dead, and he is alive again; he was lost, and he has been found.”’
\p
\c 16
\v 1 Then he said to his disciples, ‘There was a rich man who had a steward, and against him an accusation was made of squandering his assets.
\v 2 He summoned him and said to him, “What is this that I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can be steward no longer.”
\p
\v 3 The steward said to himself, “What shall I do now that my master is taking the stewardship from me? I cannot dig. I am ashamed to beg.
\v 4 I know what I shall do so that when I am removed from the stewardship they may welcome me into their homes.”
\pi
\v 5 ‘Then, summoning each of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, “How much do you owe to my master?”
\pi
\v 6 And he replied, “One hundred tubs\f + \fr 16.6 \ft ‘one hundred batoi’ – or baths, each with a capacity of 8 or 9 imp. gallons, or about 40 litres\f* of oil.”
\pi ‘And he told him, “Quickly, take your account, sit down and write fifty.”
\pi
\v 7 ‘After that he said to another, “And you, how much do you owe?”
\pi ‘And he replied, “One hundred wagonloads\f + \fr 16.7 \ft ‘one hundred kors’ – A kor was a dry measure of about 120 gallons or 500 litres capacity, or nearly half a tonne of grain\f* of wheat.”
\pi ‘He told him, “Take your account and write eighty.”
\pi
\v 8 ‘And the master applauded the dishonest steward because he had acted shrewdly, for the children of the present age are more wily than the children of the light within their own generation.
\v 9 And so I tell you, make friends for yourselves from the unrighteous idol of wealth so that, should you fail, they may welcome you into the everlasting places of shelter.
\pi
\v 10 ‘The one who is trustworthy in the smallest matter will also be trustworthy with something great; and the one who is dishonest in the smallest matter will also be dishonest with something great.
\v 11 If then you have not been trustworthy with the unrighteous idol of wealth, who will trust you with true riches\f +\fr 16:11\ft ‘riches’ is not in the Greek.\f*?
\v 12 And if you have not been trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?
\pi
\v 13 ‘No household servant can serve two masters, because either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be loyal to one and think little of the other. You cannot serve God and the idol of wealth.’
\p
\v 14 The Pharisees, who loved money and possessions, heard all this and they scoffed at him.
\v 15 He told them, ‘You are the ones who make yourselves out to be righteous in the eyes of the people, but God knows your hearts, and what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.
\pi
\v 16 ‘Until John, it was the Law and the Prophets; since then it has been the proclamation of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, and everyone is struggling to get in.
\v 17 Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny pen-stroke to drop from the Law.
\v 18 Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and everyone who marries a woman divorced by her husband commits adultery.
\pi
\v 19 ‘There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen. He revelled in luxury every day.
\v 20 And there was a poor man called Lazarus who had been deposited at his gate, covered in sores.
\v 21 He longed to be fed from the crumbs falling from the rich man’s table, and even the dogs came to lick his sores.
\v 22 In due course the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. Then the rich man died and was buried,
\v 23 and in Hades, where he was in torment, he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus in his bosom.
\v 24 Crying out, he said, “Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.”
\pi
\v 25 ‘But Abraham replied, “Child, remember that in your life you received your good things, and by the same token Lazarus received the bad things; but now he is comforted here and you are in torment.
\v 26 And besides all that, between us and you a great chasm has been established so that those who wish to cross from here to you cannot, nor may those who are there come over to us.”
\pi
\v 27 ‘He said, “Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father’s house,
\v 28 for I have five brothers, to speak seriously to them so that they too do not come to this place of torment.”
\pi
\v 29 ‘Abraham told him, “They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.”
\pi
\v 30 ‘He said, “No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.”
\pi
\v 31 ‘And he told him, “If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.”’
\p
\c 17
\v 1 He said to his disciples, ‘It is impossible for stumbling blocks not to occur, but woe betide those through whom they come.
\v 2 It would be better for them to have a millstone hung around the neck and to be thrown into the sea than that they should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
\v 3 Have regard to yourselves. If your brothers or sisters sin against you, rebuke them. And if they repent, forgive them.
\v 4 And if they sin against you seven times a day, and seven times a day they come back to you, saying, “I repent,” you shall forgive them.’
\p
\v 5 The Apostles said to the Lord, ‘Increase our faith.’
\pi
\v 6 And the Lord replied, ‘If you had faith as big as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, “Be uprooted and planted in the sea,” and it would obey you.
\pi
\v 7 ‘Who among you, with a servant ploughing or tending the sheep, will ask him when he comes in from the field to come and take a seat at the table?
\v 8 No, you will say to him, “Get my supper ready; then dress and wait on me while I eat and drink. You may eat and drink later.”
\v 9 Is he grateful to that servant for doing what was required? I think not.
\v 10 You likewise, when you have done all that is required of you, are to say, “We are servants of no worth, for we have done what we were obliged to do.”’
\p
\v 11 While journeying to Jerusalem he was travelling between Samaria and Galilee,
\v 12 and on entering a village ten men met him. They were lepers who kept their distance,
\v 13 and with raised voices they called out, ‘Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.’
\p
\v 14 When he saw them he said, ‘Go and show yourselves to the priests.’ And as they were on their way they were made clean.
\v 15 One of them, seeing that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God in a loud voice.
\v 16 Then he fell face-down at the feet of Jesus\f +\fr 17:16 \ft ‘at his feet’ in the Greek.\f*, thanking him. And this man was a Samaritan.
\p
\v 17 Jesus responded by saying, ‘Were not ten made clean? The nine, where are they?
\v 18 Was no one found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner?’
\v 19 Then he told him, ‘Rise; be on your way. Your faith has saved you.’
\p
\v 20 On being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he replied, saying, ‘The Kingdom of God does not come by being observed.
\v 21 It will never be said, “Look, here it is,” or, “Look, there it is,” because the Kingdom of God is actually within you.’
\v 22 And he told the disciples, ‘The time will come when you will long to see one of the Days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
\v 23 Then they will tell you, “Look here, look there.” Do not go. Do not follow.
\v 24 For just as lightning flashing from one side of the sky illuminates the other side of sky, so it will be with the Son of Man on his Day.
\v 25 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
\pi
\v 26 ‘And as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the Days of the Son of Man.
\v 27 They were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah went into the ark. Then the flood came and wiped out all of them.
\v 28 And the same thing happened in the days of Lot. They were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building,
\v 29 but on the day Lot left Sodom he rained fire and burning sulphur from heaven and wiped out all of them.
\v 30 That is how it will be on the Day the Son of Man is revealed.
\pi
\v 31 ‘On that Day, whoever is on the rooftop, with possessions in the house, should not go down to fetch them. And likewise, whoever is in the field should not turn back.
\v 32 Remember Lot’s wife.
\v 33 Those who seek to save their life will lose it, and those who lose it will save it.
\pi
\v 34 ‘On that night, I tell you, there will be two in one bed; one man will be taken and the other left.
\v 35 Two will be milling in the same place; one woman will be taken and the other left.
\v 36 Two will be in the field; one man will be taken and the other left.’
\p
\v 37 Their response was to ask him, ‘Where, Lord?’
\p And he told them, ‘Where the carcase is, there the eagles will be gathered.’
\p
\c 18
\v 1 He also told them a parable about the need for them to pray at all times and not grow weary.
\v 2 He said, ‘There was a judge in a certain city who did not fear God and did not respect anyone.
\v 3 And in that city there was a widow who would come to him, saying, “Avenge me of my adversary.”
\pi
\v 4 ‘For a while he would not. But then he said to himself, “Although I do not fear God or respect anyone,
\v 5 yet, because this widow is pestering me, I shall avenge her. Otherwise her perpetual visits will wear me out.”’
\p
\v 6 The Lord said, ‘Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
\v 7 Will God not grant justice to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, and bear with them patiently?
\v 8 I tell you that he will avenge them swiftly. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?’
\p
\v 9 He also told this parable to those who were convinced of their own righteousness while despising everyone else.
\p
\v 10 ‘Two men went up to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee stood praying to himself like this: “God, I thank you that I am not like other people: greedy, unrighteous, adulterous, or even like this tax collector.
\v 12 I fast twice a week. I give tithes of everything I possess.”
\pi
\v 13 ‘But the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even lift up his eyes to heaven; he was beating his breast, saying, “God be merciful to me, a sinner.”
\v 14 I tell you that this man went home made righteous, but not the other. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.’
\p
\v 15 They were bringing babies to him so that he might touch them, but when the disciples saw this they rebuked them.
\v 16 Jesus called them over and said, ‘Let the little children come to me and do not forbid them, for the Kingdom of God is for such as these.
\v 17 Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.’
\p
\v 18 Then there was a ruler who questioned him, asking, ‘Good Teacher, what have I to do so that I shall inherit everlasting life?’
\p
\v 19 Jesus said to him, ‘Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, that is God.
\v 20 You know the commandments: you shall not commit adultery; you shall not murder; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; honour your father and your mother.’
\p
\v 21 He replied, ‘I have kept all these from my youth.’
\p
\v 22 On hearing this, Jesus told him, ‘There is still one thing you lack. Sell everything, whatever you have, and distribute it among the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.’
\v 23 But when he heard this, he was deeply grieved because he was extremely rich.
\v 24 Seeing him overcome with sorrow, Jesus said, ‘How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the Kingdom of God,
\v 25 because it is easier for a camel to go in through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God.’
\p
\v 26 Those listening asked, ‘Then who can be saved?’
\p
\v 27 And he replied, ‘What is impossible for human beings is possible for God.’
\p
\v 28 Peter said, ‘You know that we have left everything and followed you.’
\p
\v 29 And he said to them, ‘Truly, I tell you that there is no one who has left house or parents, or brothers and sisters, or wife or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God,
\v 30 who will not at this time receive in return much much more, and in the age to come, everlasting life.’
\p
\v 31 Taking the Twelve aside, he said to them, ‘Listen. We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that has been written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
\v 32 For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and mocked and mistreated and spat upon,
\v 33 and after scourging him they will put him to death. Then on the third day he will rise again.’
\p
\v 34 But they grasped none of this. These words were hidden from them and they did not understand what was being said.
\p
\v 35 As he was nearing Jericho, a blind man was sitting at the roadside, begging,
\v 36 and hearing a crowd going by he asked what this was.
\v 37 When they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by,
\v 38 he shouted out, saying, ‘Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.’
\v 39 Those at the front were remonstrating with him to keep quiet, but he roared out all the more, ‘Son of David, have mercy on me.’
\p
\v 40 Jesus stopped and ordered that he be brought to him, and as he approached he asked him,
\v 41 ‘What do you want me to do for you?’
\p And he replied, ‘Lord, that I may recover my sight.’
\p
\v 42 Jesus said to him, ‘Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.’
\p
\v 43 He recovered his sight instantly and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people watching offered praise to God.
\p
\c 19
\v 1 He entered Jericho, and was passing through
\v 2 when a man called Zacchaeus appeared. He was a chief tax collector, and rich.
\v 3 He wanted to catch sight of Jesus, to see who he was, but being small in stature he could not because of the crowd.
\v 4 He ran on ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see him, because he was about to pass by.
\p
\v 5 When Jesus reached the place, he looked up and saw him and said to him, ‘Zacchaeus, come down quickly. Today I must stay at your house.’
\p
\v 6 He hurried down and welcomed him joyfully.
\v 7 But when they saw this they grumbled, saying, ‘He has gone to stay with a sinful man.’
\p
\v 8 Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, ‘Listen, Lord. I am giving half of what belongs to me to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I shall repay it four times over.’
\p
\v 9 And Jesus said of him, ‘Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.
\v 10 For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.’
\p
\v 11 As they listened to these things, he went on to relate a parable. Because he was near Jerusalem they supposed that the Kingdom of God would appear at any moment,
\v 12 and so he said, ‘A man of noble birth was going to a distant country to accept for himself a kingdom, and then returning.
\v 13 Summoning ten of his own servants he gave them ten pounds\f +\fr 19:13\ft ‘ten minae’ – A mina was was worth 100 denarii, or about one pound weight in silver.\f* and told them, “Trade with this until I return.”
\pi
\v 14 ‘But his subjects hated him, and they sent a delegation after him to say, “We do not want this man to rule over us.”
\pi
\v 15 ‘Now on his return, after accepting the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be summoned so that he might discover whether any of them had made a profit through business.
\pi
\v 16 ‘The first appeared, saying, “Lord, your pound has made ten pounds more.”
\pi
\v 17 ‘And he said to him, “Well done, good servant. Because you have proved trustworthy with a very little, have jurisdiction over ten towns.”
\pi
\v 18 ‘Then the second appeared, saying, “Lord, your pound has made five pounds.”
\pi
\v 19 ‘And he said to this one too, “Be in charge of five towns.”
\pi
\v 20 ‘Then another appeared, saying, “Lord, here is your pound. I kept it wrapped in a handkerchief,
\v 21 for I was afraid of you because you are a hard man. You pick up what you have not put down, and reap what you have not sown, and gather up what you have not threshed.”
\pi
\v 22 ‘He told him, “Good-for-nothing servant! I shall condemn you out of your own mouth. You knew that I was a hard man, picking up what I had not put down, and reaping what I had not sown, and gathering up what I had not threshed.
\v 23 Why then did you not deposit my money in the bank? I would then have collected it with interest on my return.”
\v 24 And to those standing there he said, “Take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.”
\v 25 They said, “Lord, he has ten pounds!”
\v 26 “I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given; but from those who have not, even what they have will be taken from them.
\v 27 As for those enemies of mine who did not want me to rule over them, bring them here and slaughter them in front of me.”’
\v 28 After saying this, he went on ahead on his way up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 As he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent off two of his disciples,
\v 30 saying, ‘Make your way to the village opposite. There, as you go in, you will find a foal tied up upon which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.
\v 31 If anyone asks you, “Why are you untying it?” say this to them, “The Lord needs it.”’
\p
\v 32 And those dispatched went and found the foal standing there, just as he had told them;
\v 33 and as they were untying the foal, its owners said to them, ‘Why are you letting the foal loose?’
\p
\v 34 And they replied, ‘Because the Lord needs it.’
\p
\v 35 Then they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks over the foal, and set Jesus upon it.
\v 36 As he went on his way, they spread their cloaks beneath him on the road.
\v 37 And, on the descent from the Mount of Olives, as he drew nearer the whole company of disciples began to cheer and to praise God in a mighty voice for all the miracles they had seen,
\v 38 calling out, ‘Blessed is the King, he who comes in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.’
\p
\v 39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, ‘Teacher, rebuke your disciples.’
\p
\v 40 But replying, he told them, ‘I say to you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.’
\p
\v 41 When he came closer and saw the city, he wept over it,
\v 42 saying, ‘On this your day if you, yes you, had only recognised what brings you peace. But now it is hidden from your eyes.
\v 43 For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a fortification against you and surround you and hem you in on every side.
\v 44 They will raze you to the ground with your children within you. They will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognise the moment when you were visited.’
\p
\v 45 Then he entered the Temple and began to drive out those in it who were buying and selling,
\v 46 saying to them, ‘It is written that my house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.’
\p
\v 47 And he would teach daily in the Temple while the chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,
\v 48 but they found there was nothing that they could do because all the people listening to him were hanging on every word.
\p
\c 20
\v 1 On one of those days when he was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the Gospel, the priests and the scribes were there with the elders.
\v 2 They said to him, ‘Tell us on what authority you are doing this. Who gave you this authority?’
\p
\v 3 He replied, saying to them, ‘I shall also ask you one question. Tell me about
\v 4 the baptism of John. Was it from heaven or of human origin?’
\p
\v 5 They discussed it among themselves. ‘If we say it was from heaven, he will reply, “Why then did you not believe him?”
\v 6 But if we say it was of human origin, all the people will stone us because they are convinced that John was a prophet.’
\v 7 They therefore replied that they did not know where it was from.
\p
\v 8 And Jesus said to them, ‘Neither will I tell you on what authority I am doing this.’
\p
\v 9 He told the people this parable. ‘There was a man who planted a vineyard, leased it to vine-growers, and went abroad for a long time.
\v 10 At the appropriate season he sent a servant to the growers so that they might give him some of the produce of the vineyard. But the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 11 He did more, sending another servant to them, but they showed him no respect. They beat him as well, and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 12 He did more, sending a third, and they wounded him too and threw him out.
\v 13 Then the master of the vineyard said, “What shall I do? I shall send my beloved son. Perhaps, when they see him, they will show respect.”
\pi
\v 14 ‘But when the vine-growers saw him they discussed it among themselves, saying, “This is the heir. Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.”
\v 15 And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
\pi ‘Now what will the master of the vineyard do to them?
\v 16 He will come and wipe out those vine-growers and give the vineyard to others.’
\p On hearing it, they exclaimed, ‘May it never happen!’
\p
\v 17 He looked at them and said, ‘Then what is this that is written? “It is the stone which the builders rejected that has become the chief cornerstone.”\rq Psalms 117[118]:22\rq*
\v 18 Everyone who falls over that stone will be dashed to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be ground to dust.’
\p
\v 19 At that moment the chief priests and the scribes wanted to seize him because they knew that he was telling the parables against them, but they feared the people.
\v 20 They therefore watched him; and they sent out spies, who pretended to be genuine, to catch him out in what he said in order to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.
\v 21 They questioned him, saying, ‘Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and that you are not taken in by appearances but truly teach God’s way.
\v 22 Are we allowed to pay taxes to Caesar or not?’
\p
\v 23 But he, seeing through their duplicity, said to them, ‘Why are you setting a trap for me?
\v 24 Show me a coin\f + \fr 20.24 \ft ‘a denarius’.\f*. Whose image and inscription does it carry?’
\p They replied, ‘Caesar’s.’
\p
\v 25 He told them, ‘Well then, give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And to God what belongs to God.’
\p
\v 26 And so they were not able to catch him out through what he said in front of the people. Marvelling at his answer, they fell silent.
\p
\v 27 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came up and questioned him.
\v 28 They said, ‘Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone who has a wife, but dies childless, has a brother, then that brother should marry the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.
\v 29 Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and died childless.
\v 30 Then the second took the wife, and that one died childless.
\v 31 Then the third took her, and the same with all seven: they left no children and died.
\v 32 Last of all the woman also died.
\v 33 At the resurrection, then, of which of them will she be the wife? For the seven took her as wife.’
\p
\v 34 And in reply Jesus told them, ‘The children of this age marry and are given in marriage,
\v 35 but those who are judged worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 They cannot die any more, for they are like angels; and they are children of God, being children of the resurrection.
\pi
\v 37 ‘But that the dead are raised, even Moses demonstrated at the bush when he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
\v 38 He is not a God of the dead but of the living, for all live through him.’
\p
\v 39 Responding, some of the scribes said, ‘Teacher, you have spoken well.’
\v 40 And they no longer dared question him about anything.
\p
\v 41 He asked them, ‘How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son?
\v 42 David himself says in the book of the Psalms, “The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand
\v 43 until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.’”\rq Psalms 109[110]:1\rq*
\v 44 David is therefore calling him Lord, so how is he his son?’
\p
\v 45 With all the people listening, he said to his disciples,
\v 46 ‘Beware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted in the marketplaces, and they love the front seats in the synagogues and the top table at feasts.
\v 47 They, who gobble up widows’ houses and for outward show pray at great length, will receive an especially severe condemnation.’
\p
\c 21
\v 1 Looking up, he saw those who were casting their gifts into the treasury, rich people.
\v 2 Then he saw a poor widow putting in two tiny coins\f + \fr 21:2 \ft ‘two lepta’ – The lepton was the smallest coin of all and was worth 1/128th of a denarius.\f*,
\v 3 and he said, ‘Truly I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than anyone.
\v 4 For they all put in gifts for God from their surplus, but she, from her poverty, put in all she had in life.’
\p
\v 5 There were some who were saying about the Temple that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive offerings. He said,
\v 6 ‘As for these things you gaze at, the day will come when no stone will be left on another stone without being thrown down.’
\p
\v 7 They questioned him, asking, ‘When will this happen, Teacher? And what will be the sign that it is about to happen?’
\p
\v 8 He replied, ‘See that you are not led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, “I am he” and, “The time has come.” Do not go after them.
\v 9 And when you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened, for these things must happen first, but the end will not come at once.’
\p
\v 10 Then he told them, ‘Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,
\v 11 and there will be great earthquakes everywhere and famines and plagues, and there will be frightening portents and mighty signs from heaven.
\v 12 But before all this you will be seized and persecuted, delivered up to the synagogues and prisons, brought before kings and governors on account of my name.
\v 13 And it will become your testimony,
\v 14 so make up your minds not to rehearse your defence in advance,
\v 15 for I shall give you a voice and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to refute or resist.
\v 16 You will be betrayed, even by parents and relatives and friends and brothers and sisters, and they will put some of you to death.
\v 17 Yes, you will be hated by everyone because of my name,
\v 18 but not a hair on your head will perish.
\v 19 Through your endurance you will take possession of your souls.
\pi
\v 20 ‘When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you will know that her destruction is near.
\v 21 Those in Judaea should then flee to the mountains, and those in the city should leave, and those in the countryside should not go there.
\v 22 For these are days of retribution, the fulfilment of everything that has been written.
\v 23 Pity those who are with child and those breast-feeding in those days, for at that time there will be great distress across the land and anger against this people.
\v 24 They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive to all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the time for the nations is fulfilled.
\pi
\v 25 ‘Then there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on earth the distress of nations in turmoil, the roaring of sea and wave.
\v 26 People’s hearts will fail from fear and dread of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be toppled.
\v 27 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\v 28 When these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.’
\p
\v 29 Then he told them a parable. ‘Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
\v 30 When it is time for them to bud, you yourselves notice and you realise that summer is now at hand.
\v 31 In this way, when you see these things happening, you will know that the Kingdom of God is at hand.
\v 32 Truly I say to you that this generation will not pass away until everything has happened.
\v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away.
\pi
\v 34 ‘Have regard to yourselves so that your minds do not become dulled by overindulgence and drunkenness and life’s cares, for then that Day may creep up on you suddenly
\v 35 because it will spring like a trap upon everyone living on the face of the whole earth.
\v 36 Therefore be vigilant at all times, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all that is going to happen and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.’
\p
\v 37 By day he would teach in the Temple, and by night he would go out and remain on the Mount of Olives.
\v 38 Then at dawn all the people would come to him on the mountain to listen to him.
\p
\c 22
\v 1 The feast of Unleavened Bread known as Passover was drawing near,
\v 2 and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to do away with him but they were afraid of the people.
\v 3 Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot who was numbered among the Twelve,
\v 4 and he went to consult with the chief priests and scribes and Temple officers about how he might deliver him up to them.
\v 5 They were delighted and promised to give him money.
\v 6 He agreed, and began looking for an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.
\p
\v 7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread when the Passover had to be sacrificed,
\v 8 and he sent Peter and John, saying, ‘Go and prepare the Passover for us so that we may eat.’
\p
\v 9 They asked him, ‘Where do you want us to make preparations?’
\p
\v 10 And he told them, ‘Listen. As you enter the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house where he goes in
\v 11 and tell the master of the house, “The Teacher says to you, ‘Where is the guest room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’”
\v 12 He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make the preparations there.’
\v 13 They went and found it as he had told them, and they prepared for the Passover.
\p
\v 14 When the time came, he sat down with the Twelve Apostles
\v 15 and said to them, ‘I have had a great desire to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
\v 16 for I tell you that I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.’
\v 17 Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and said, ‘Take this and share it among you,
\v 18 for I tell you that I shall not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God has come.’
\p
\v 19 Then he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body which is being offered for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’
\v 20 And after they had eaten, in the same way the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is being poured out for you.
\v 21 But listen, the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table.
\v 22 It is true that the Son of Man goes on his way as it is ordained, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.’
\p
\v 23 They began to speculate among themselves about which of them it might be who was going to do this.
\v 24 And then an argument arose among them about which of them was reckoned to be the greatest.
\v 25 He said to them, ‘The kings of the nations exercise lordship over them, and those who wield power over them are called benefactors.
\v 26 But for you, it is not like that. No, the one who is the greatest among you will be like the youngest, and the one who is in charge, like the one who serves.
\v 27 For who is greater: the one seated at the table, or the one serving? Is it not the one sitting down? Yet I am among you as one who serves.
\p
\v 28 As for you, you are the ones who have stayed with me throughout my trials,
\v 29 and I am bestowing upon you a kingdom, just as my Father has bestowed one upon me,
\v 30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom where you will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.’
\p
\v 31 Then the Lord said, ‘Simon, Simon, do you know that Satan wanted to sift you like wheat?
\v 32 But I have prayed for you so that your faith may not fail you. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers and sisters.’
\p
\v 33 He told him, ‘Lord, I am ready to go with you, both to imprisonment and to death.’
\p
\v 34 But he replied, ‘I tell you, Peter, that the cock will not crow today before you have denied three times that you know me.’
\p
\v 35 And he asked them, ‘When I sent you out without a purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?’
\p They said, ‘Nothing.’
\p
\v 36 Then he said to them, ‘But now, whoever has a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and whoever does not have a sword should sell his coat and buy one.
\v 37 For I tell you that this which has been written must be fulfilled in me: “He was numbered with transgressors.” For those things that relate to me are nearing completion.’
\p
\v 38 They said, ‘Look, Lord, here are two swords.’
\p And he told them, ‘That is enough.’
\p
\v 39 Then going out, he went as usual to the Mount of Olives and his disciples followed him.
\p
\v 40 When he reached the place he told them, ‘Pray that you do not fall into temptation.’
\v 41 He then withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down and prayed.
\v 42 He was saying, ‘Father, if it is your will, take this cup from me. Nevertheless let your will, not mine, be done.’
\v 43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
\v 44 In anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling to the ground.
\p
\v 45 Rising from prayer, he went back to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief.
\v 46 He said to them, ‘Why are you sleeping? Wake up and pray that you do not fall into temptation.’
\p
\v 47 As he was speaking a crowd appeared, and the one called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He came up to Jesus to kiss him, for he had given them this sign: ‘The one whom I kiss is the man.’
\v 48 Jesus said to him, ‘Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?’
\p
\v 49 When those around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, ‘Lord, shall we strike with the sword?’
\v 50 One of them struck the High Priest’s servant and took off his right ear,
\v 51 but Jesus responded with, ‘That is enough.’ Then he touched his ear and healed him.
\p
\v 52 Jesus said to those who had come for him, the chief priests and Temple officers and elders, ‘Have you come out as against a bandit with swords and staves?
\v 53 When I was with you daily in the Temple you did not stretch out your hands against me, but this is your hour: the rule of darkness.’
\v 54 Seizing him, they led him away and brought him to the High Priest’s house. Peter was following, well behind.
\p
\v 55 They kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together. Peter was seated among them,
\v 56 and a servant girl saw him sitting there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, ‘This man was with him as well.’
\p
\v 57 But he denied it, saying, ‘Woman, I do not know him.’
\p
\v 58 After a while someone else saw him and said, ‘You too are one of them.’
\p But Peter replied, ‘Man, I am not.’
\p
\v 59 After a space of an hour or so, some other person was insistent, saying, ‘Surely this man was also with him, for he is a Galilean.’
\p
\v 60 But Peter said, ‘Man, I do not know what you are talking about.’ And at once, as he was speaking, a cock crowed.
\v 61 And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered what the Lord had said, how he had told him, ‘Before the cock crows you will disown me three times.’
\v 62 And Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 Now the men who were detaining Jesus were mocking him and beating him.
\v 64 They blindfolded him and were hitting him in the face, demanding, ‘Prophesy who hit you.’
\v 65 And they threw many other insults at him.
\p
\v 66 As soon as it was day, the elders of the people came together with the chief priests and the scribes and they brought him before their Sanhedrin, saying,
\v 67 ‘If you are the Christ, tell us.’
\p And he replied, ‘If I tell you, you will not believe;
\v 68 and if I ask anything, you will not answer me or release me.
\v 69 From now on the Son of Man shall sit at the right hand of the Power of God.’
\p
\v 70 And they all responded, ‘You are the Son of God, then?’
\p He told them, ‘You yourselves affirm that I am.’
\p
\v 71 Then they said, ‘What further need do we have of evidence? For we have heard it from his mouth.’
\p
\c 23
\v 1 The whole assembly rose up and brought Jesus\f +\fr 23:1\ft ‘him’ in the Greek.\f* before Pilate.
\v 2 They began to lay charges against him, saying, ‘We found this man subverting the nation, forbidding the payment of tax to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.’
\p
\v 3 Pilate questioned him. He asked, ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’
\p  In reply he said, ‘Those are your words.’
\p
\v 4 Pilate announced to the chief priests and to the crowd, ‘I find no fault in this man.’
\p
\v 5 But they were all the more insistent, saying, ‘He is stirring up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, from Galilee where he began, all the way here.’
\v 6 Now when Pilate heard ‘Galilee’ he asked if the man were a Galilean,
\v 7 and discovering that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
\p
\v 8 When Herod saw Jesus he was very pleased because he had wanted to see him for some time. He had heard much about him and was hoping to see some miracle done by him.
\v 9 He questioned him at great length but received no answers.
\v 10 The scribes and the chief priests stood by, vehemently denouncing him.
\v 11 Then Herod with his soldiers humiliated him. In mockery, they dressed him in a magnificent robe and sent him back to Pilate.
\v 12 Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that day, for previously they had been hostile towards each other.
\p
\v 13 Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people.
\v 14 He said to them, ‘You brought this man to me as one subverting the people, but under questioning in your presence I have not found this man guilty of any of the charges you laid against him.
\v 15 No, and neither has Herod, because I sent you to him. Nothing deserving death has been done by him.
\v 16 I shall therefore flog him and release him.’
\v 17 For he was under an obligation to release someone for them at each feast.
\p
\v 18 But with everyone yelling at once, they shouted, ‘Away with this man! Release for us Barabbas.’
\v 19 This man had been thrown into prison because of an insurrection in the city, and for murder.
\p
\v 20 Then Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, again appealed to them,
\v 21 but they went on chanting, ‘Crucify! Crucify him!’
\p
\v 22 For the third time he called out to them, ‘Why? What harm has he done? I have found in him nothing deserving death. I shall flog him and then release him.’
\p
\v 23 But with deafening shouts they were relentless, demanding that he be crucified, and their voices with those of the chief priests prevailed.
\v 24 And so Pilate decreed that what they asked should be done.
\v 25 He released for them Barabbas as they requested, the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, and he surrendered Jesus to their own purposes.
\p
\v 26 As they led him away they detained Simon, a man from Cyrene returning from the countryside. They laid the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.
\v 27 A great company of people were following him, including women who were beating their breasts and lamenting him.
\v 28 Jesus turned to them and said, ‘Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children.
\v 29 For the days are coming when they will say, “Blessed are the barren, the wombs that have not given birth and the breasts that have not nursed.”
\v 30 Then they will start saying to the mountains, “Fall on us,” and to the hills, “Bury us.”
\v 31 For if they do these things when the timber is wet, what will happen when it is dry?’
\p
\v 32 There were others with him, two criminals who were also to be put to death.
\v 33 And when they reached the place called The Skull, there they crucified him with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
\v 34 Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.’ Then  they threw dice to divide up his garments.
\p
\v 35 The people were standing by, watching; and the rulers were also there with them, sneering and saying, ‘He saved others; let him save himself if this is the Christ, the Chosen One of God.’
\p
\v 36 The soldiers were mocking him as well, coming up and offering him sour wine
\v 37 and saying, ‘If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.’
\p
\v 38 There was also a notice placed above him, written in Greek and Latin and Hebrew, ‘This is the king of the Jews’.
\p
\v 39 One of the criminals being hanged was insulting him, saying, ‘If you are the Christ, save yourself, and us.’
\p
\v 40 But the other responded, rebuking him, saying, ‘Have you no fear, even of God? For you are under the same condemnation,
\v 41 and we indeed justly because we are getting what we deserve for what we did. But this man has done nothing amiss.’
\v 42 Then he said to Jesus, ‘Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.’
\p
\v 43 And Jesus told him, ‘Truly I say to you that today you will be with me in Paradise.’
\p
\v 44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell upon the whole land until the ninth hour,
\v 45 for the sun was eclipsed. Then the veil of the sanctuary was torn down the middle,
\v 46 and Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, ‘Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.’ And as he said this he breathed his last.
\p
\v 47 When the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, ‘Truly, this was a righteous man.’
\v 48 And when all the crowds that had gathered for the spectacle saw what had happened, they turned away, beating their breasts.
\v 49 All who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, had been standing a long way off, watching these things.
\p
\v 50 Then a man called Joseph appeared, a member of the Sanhedrin, a good and righteous man
\v 51 who had not agreed to what they had planned and done. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he too was waiting for the Kingdom of God.
\v 52 This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 53 When he had taken him down, he wrapped him in a bleached linen cloth and placed him in a tomb hewn from the rock where no one had yet been laid.
\v 54 It was Preparation Day. The Sabbath was drawing near.
\p
\v 55 The women who had come with him from Galilee had followed and seen the tomb where his body was laid,
\v 56 and they returned and prepared spices and ointments. Then on the Sabbath they rested, observing the commandment.
\p
\c 24
\v 1 Just before sunrise on the first day of the week, the women\f +\fr 24:1\ft ‘they’ in the Greek.\f* went to the tomb with some others, carrying the spices they had prepared.
\v 2 They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb
\v 3 and went in, but they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
\v 4 While they were wondering about this, two men in dazzling clothing appeared beside them.
\v 5 They became frightened and bowed their faces to the ground.
\p They asked them, ‘Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
\v 6 He is not here, but has been raised. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee.
\v 7 He said that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinners and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.’
\v 8 And they remembered his words.
\p
\v 9 Returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven and to all the others.
\v 10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told the Apostles these things,
\v 11 but what they said seemed to them to be nonsense, and they did not believe them.
\v 12 But Peter set off and ran to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linen bandages lying by themselves. Then he went home in awe of what had happened.
\p
\v 13 And there was this. Two of them were travelling that day to a village named Emmaus, seven miles\f +\fr 24:13\ft ‘sixty stadia’ – A stadion was about one eighth of a Roman mile.\f* distant from Jerusalem,
\v 14 and they were talking to one another about all that had happened.
\v 15 Then while they were conversing and discussing together, Jesus came up and kept company with them,
\v 16 but their eyes were prevented from recognising him.
\v 17 He said to them, ‘These exchanges between you as you walk along, what are they about? And why are you so gloomy?’
\p
\v 18 One of them named Cleopas replied, saying to him, ‘Are you alone in being such a stranger to Jerusalem that you do not know what has happened there recently?’
\p
\v 19 He asked them, ‘What things?’
\p And they told him, ‘Things concerning Jesus of Nazareth who became a man, a prophet, powerful in deed and word in the sight of God and of all the people.
\v 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
\v 21 We were hoping that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And in addition to all that, today is the third day since this happened
\v 22 and now some of our women have astonished us. They went early to the tomb
\v 23 but did not find his body. They returned, saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he is alive.
\v 24 Then some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.’
\p
\v 25 He said to them, ‘Such a lack of understanding, and so slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have told.
\v 26 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer like this and to enter into his glory?’
\v 27 And beginning with Moses and all the prophets he explained to them from the whole of Scripture things about himself.
\p
\v 28 As they were drawing near to the village to which they were going, he made as if to go on further,
\v 29 but they constrained him, saying, ‘Stay with us, for it is almost evening and the day wears on.’ And so he went in to stay with them.
\p
\v 30 Then as he sat at table with them he took the bread, and after blessing it and breaking it, he gave it to them.
\v 31 Their eyes were opened and they recognised him; then he vanished from their sight.
\v 32 They said one to another, ‘Were our hearts not burning within us while he was speaking to us on the road, and as he was opening the Scriptures to us?’
\v 33 And they set off at that very hour and returned to Jerusalem.
\p They found the Eleven gathered, and those with them.
\v 34 They were saying, ‘The Lord has risen indeed! He has been seen by Simon.’
\v 35 Then they related what had happened on the road, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.
\p
\v 36 While they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, ‘Peace be with you.’
\p
\v 37 They were terrified and became fearful; they thought they were seeing a spirit.
\v 38 But he said to them, ‘Why are you troubled? What is the reason for the thoughts welling up in your minds?
\v 39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I. Touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.’
\v 40 And saying this, he showed them his hands and feet.
\v 41 They were overwhelmed with joy and could not believe it. He said to them, ‘Have you anything here to eat?’
\v 42 They gave him a portion of grilled fish and some honeycomb,
\v 43 which he took and ate in front of them.
\p
\v 44 He said to them, ‘This is what I told you when I was still with you: that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.’
\v 45 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
\v 46 and he told them, ‘As it has been written, so must the Christ suffer and rise from the dead on the third day;
\v 47 and repentance and forgiveness must be proclaimed in his name to all the nations starting from Jerusalem.
\v 48 You are witnesses of these things.
\v 49 And understand that I am sending upon you the promise of my Father. Therefore remain in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.’
\p
\v 50 He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.
\v 51 While he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven.
\v 52 They worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
\v 53 And they were constantly in the Temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
\p
