\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
\v 2 This is he who was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 Everything came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be that has come to be.
\v 4 In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of humankind.
\v 5 The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
\v 6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
\v 7 This is he who came as a witness, to bear witness to the Light so that all might believe through him.
\v 8 He was not the Light, but [came] to bear witness to the Light.
\v 9 The true Light who enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and the world had come to be through him, but the world did not know him.
\v 11 He came to his own, and those who were his own did not accept him.
\v 12 But to all who did accept him, to those who believe in his name, he gave the power to become children of God.
\v 13 They were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a man, but of God.
\p
\v 14 And the Word became flesh and settled among us. We looked upon his glory, glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John bore witness to him and cried out, saying, “This is he of whom I said, ‘He who is coming after me comes before me, because he was before me.’”
\v 16 From his plenty we have all received grace upon grace.
\v 17 Though the law was given through Moses, grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No one has ever seen God. The Only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he has revealed [him].
\p
\v 19 Now this is the testimony of John. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, ‘Who are you?’,
\v 20 then he acknowledged and did not deny, but acknowledged, “I am not the Christ.”
\p
\v 21 So they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”,
\p and he said, “I am not.”
\p “Are you the prophet?”,
\p but he answered, “No.”
\p
\v 22 They then said to him, “Who are you? In order for us to give an answer to those who sent us, what do you say about yourself?”
\p
\v 23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord’, as Isaiah the prophet said.”\rq Isaiah 40:3\rq*
\p
\v 24 Now those who had been sent were of the Pharisees,
\v 25 and they questioned him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”
\p
\v 26 John answered them, saying, “I am baptizing in water, but among you stands one whom you do not know.
\v 27 It is he who is coming after me, who was before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.”
\p
\v 28 These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\p
\v 29 On the following day John saw Jesus approaching him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
\v 30 This is the one of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me because he was before me.’
\v 31 I myself did not know him, but so that he might be revealed to Israel – that is the reason I came baptizing in water.”
\v 32 And John testified saying, “I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and it remained over him.
\v 33 I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptise in water told me, ‘The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining – this is he who baptises in the Holy Spirit.’
\v 34 I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”
\p
\v 35 Again on the following day John was standing with two of his disciples.
\v 36 He saw Jesus as he walked by and said, “Look! The Lamb of God.”
\v 37 The two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus.
\v 38 Turning and seeing them following, Jesus asked them, “What do you want?”
\p They said to him, “Rabbi,” – which means Teacher – “where are you staying?”
\p
\v 39 He said to them, “Come and see.”
\p They went, saw where he was staying and remained with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
\v 40 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John and had followed Jesus.
\v 41 First he found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” – which means Anointed\f or Christ\f*.
\v 42 He brought him to Jesus who looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Kephas” – which means Rock\f i.e. Peter\f*.
\v 43 The following day Jesus decided to go out into Galilee where he found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”
\v 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have discovered the one of whom Moses in the law and the prophets have written: Jesus the son of Joseph who is from Nazareth.”
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”
\p Philip replied, “Come and see.”
\p
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael approaching him and he said about him, “Look! An Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile.”
\p
\v 48 Nathanael asked him, “How do you know me?”
\p Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
\p
\v 49 Nathanael answered and said to him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.”
\p
\v 50 Jesus said to him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ you believe! You will see greater things than these.”
\v 51 He said to him, “Truly, truly, I tell you that you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”
\p

\v 1 On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
\v 2 Jesus was also invited to the wedding with his disciples.
\v 3 Then the wine ran out. Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”
\p
\v 4 Jesus said to her, “What [is that] to me and you, woman? My time has not yet come.”
\p
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he tells you, do it.”
\v 6 Now, there were six stone water jars, placed there for ceremonial washing by the Jews, each holding about one hundred litres\f + \fr 3.6: \fk one hundred litres: \ft Literally, ‘two or three metretas’. A metretes equates to about 9 imp. gallons (a firkin) or 40 litres.\f*.
\v 7 Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim.
\v 8 He then said to them, “Now draw some off and take it to the master of ceremonies.” And they took it.
\v 9 When the master of ceremonies had tasted the water – become wine – but not knowing the source, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of ceremonies called to the bridegroom
\v 10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first and then, when [the guests] have drunk freely, the less good. You have kept the good wine until now!”
\v 11 This, the first of the signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. Thus he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
\p
\v 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers and sisters, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
\p
\v 13 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem;
\v 14 and in the temple he found those selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money changers sitting there.
\v 15 So he made a whip from reeds and he drove them all out of the temple, including the sheep and the oxen; he also emptied out the coins of the money-changers and overturned the tables.
\v 16 Then to those selling the pigeons he said, “Take these things out of here. Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace.”
\v 17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, 
\q1 ‘Zeal for your house will consume me.’\rq Psalms 68[69]:9\rq*
\m
\p
\v 18 So the Jews demanded, “What sign are you showing us? Why you are doing this?”
\p
\v 19 Jesus responded by saying to them, “Destroy this sanctuary and in three days I will raise it up again.”
\p
\v 20 Then the Jews said, “This sanctuary has taken forty-six years to build, and you will put it up in three days!”
\v 21 But he was speaking of the sanctuary of his body.
\v 22 Now, when he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and what Jesus had said.
\p
\v 23 While he was in Jerusalem for the Passover, during the feast many put their trust in his name, watching his signs which he was performing.
\v 24 But Jesus did not trust himself to them because he understood them all,
\v 25 because he did not need anyone to testify about an individual, for he himself knew what was in the person.
\p
\c 3
\v 1 Now, there was a man among the Pharisees: Nicodemus his name, a leader of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to him by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we are aware that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one could perform the signs which you perform if God were not with him.”
\p
\v 3 Replying, Jesus said to him, “Truly, truly, I tell you that those who are not born anew cannot see the Kingdom of God.”
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus asked him, “How can someone who is old be born? Can one enter one's mother’s womb a second time and be born?”
\p
\v 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I tell you that those who are not born of water and Spirit cannot enter the Kingdom of God.
\v 6 What has been born of the flesh is flesh; and what has been born of the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’
\v 8 The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone who has been born of the Spirit.”
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus asked him, “How can that happen?”
\p
\v 10 Jesus replied, saying to him, “You are the teacher of Israel! Yet you do not understand these things.
\v 11 Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we bear witness to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
\v 12 If I have told you the things of this world and you do not believe, how are you to believe if I tell you the things of heaven?
\v 13 No one has ascended into heaven except he who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
\v 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up
\v 15 so that everyone who believes in him might not perish, but have everlasting life.
\v 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his Son, the Only-begotten, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but have everlasting life.
\v 17 For God did not send his Son into the world so that he might judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.
\v 18 Those who believe in him are not judged, but those who do not believe have already been judged, because they have not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
\v 19 And this is the judgement, that the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For all who commit evil hate the light, and they do not come to the light so that their deeds might not be exposed.
\v 21 But those who practise the truth, they come to the light so that their deeds may be revealed as having been done through God.”
\p
\v 22 After this, Jesus went with his disciples to the territory of Judea and stayed there with them, and baptised.
\v 23 John was also baptizing at Enon near Salim because there was a lot of water there, and people were coming and being baptised
\v 24 – for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
\v 25 Then a question arose from among the disciples of John with some Jews about ceremonial purification,
\v 26 and they went to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, look, he is baptizing and they are all going to him.”
\p
\v 27 John, answering, said, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves bear witness that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.’
\v 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the bridegroom’s friend who stands listening to him is filled with joy by the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore my joy is made complete by this.
\v 30 It is right for him to increase and for me to decrease.”
\p
\v 31 He who comes from above is above everything; he who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; he who comes from heaven is above everything.
\v 32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
\v 33 The one who accepts his testimony attests that God is Truth.
\v 34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, because God gives the Spirit without limit.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has committed everything into his hand.
\v 36 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life. The one who does not believe in the Son will not see life, and the wrath of God rests upon that person.
\p

\v 1 Then, when the Lord learnt that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 – though it was his disciples, not Jesus himself, who were baptizing,
\v 3 he left Judea and went to Galilee.
\v 4 It was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.
\v 5 He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the plot of land Jacob had given to his son Joseph;
\v 6 and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, fatigued by the journey, was sitting, for that reason, by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
\v 7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me [something] to drink.”
\v 8 For his disciples had gone away into the town to buy food.
\p
\v 9 The Samaritan woman then said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
\p
\v 10 Jesus replied, saying to her, “If you were aware of the gift of God and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give me [something] to drink’, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
\p
\v 11 The woman said to him, “Lord, you have nothing with which to draw and the well is deep. So where do you keep the living water?
\v 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his children and his livestock?”
\p
\v 13 Replying, Jesus said to her, “Everyone drinking this water will be thirsty again,
\v 14 but those who drink the water that I shall give them will never be thirsty. And the water I shall give them will become in them a source of water springing up to everlasting life.”
\p
\v 15 The woman said to him, “Lord, give me this water so that I may not be thirsty – nor come here to draw.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”
\p
\v 17 The woman answered and said, “I do not have a husband.”
\p Jesus said to her, “You said honestly, ‘I do not have a husband,’
\v 18 for you have had five husbands, and now, the one you have is not your husband. In this you have spoken the truth.”
\p
\v 19 The woman said to him, “Lord, I see you are a prophet.
\v 20 Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you – you say that Jerusalem is the place where one should worship.”
\p
\v 21 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me! A time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
\v 22 You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.
\v 23 But a time is coming – and it is now – when the true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth, for the Father wants such as these to worship him.
\v 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and Truth.”
\p
\v 25 The woman said to him, “I know that a Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When he comes, he will tell us everything.”
\p
\v 26 Jesus said to her, “I am he, who is speaking to you.”
\v 27 And with that, his disciples arrived; and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What are you doing?” or, “Why are you speaking with her?”
\v 28 Then the woman left her water jar and went off into the town and said to the people,
\v 29 “Come and see someone who has told me everything, all that I have done. Is this the Christ?”
\p
\v 30 They left the town and went to him.
\v 31 Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he told them, “I have food to eat of which you are not aware.”
\p
\v 33 So the disciples said to one another, “Could someone have brought him something to eat?”
\p
\v 34 Jesus told them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.
\v 35 Do you not say, ‘Four months more and the harvest will be here?’ Look, I tell you! Raise your eyes and look at the fields – they are already bright for harvest.
\v 36 So then, the reaper receives wages and gathers fruit for life everlasting, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
\v 37 Because here the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’
\v 38 I send you out to reap that for which you have not laboured. Others have laboured, and you have come to share in their labour.”
\p
\v 39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of what the woman had said, testifying, “He told me everything that I have done.”
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to him they began begging him to stay with them. He stayed there for two days,
\v 41 and many more believed because of what he said.
\v 42 Then they said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard and understand that this is truly the Saviour of the world, the Christ.”
\p
\v 43 After the two days he left there and went to Galilee.
\v 44 Now, Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country,
\v 45 but when he arrived in Galilee the Galileans welcomed him, having witnessed all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.
\v 46 So Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee where he had made the water wine. And there was a nobleman whose son was ill at Capernaum,
\v 47 who, when he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee went to him and begged him to go down and heal his son, for he was about to die.
\v 48 Then Jesus told him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will never believe.”
\p
\v 49 The nobleman said to him, “Lord, come down before my child dies.”
\v 50 Jesus replied, “Go on your way. Your son lives.” And the man believed what Jesus had told him and went on his way.
\v 51 While he was on the way down his servants met him and reported the news, saying, “Your child lives.”
\v 52 Then he asked them the time at which he began to improve, and they told him, “Yesterday, at the seventh hour the fever left him.”
\v 53 And the father knew that that was the time when Jesus had said to him, “Your son lives.” And he believed, he and his whole household.
\v 54 This was now the second sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.
\p
\c 5
\v 1 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 There is in Jerusalem, by the sheep gate, a pool with five colonnades called in Hebrew, Bethesda.
\v 3 Under these were lying a great number of the diseased, blind, lame, emaciated, waiting for the movement of the water
\p
\v 4 – for occasionally an angel went down into the pool and stirred up the water. Then, the first to get in after the movement of the water was healed of whatever infirmity that person had.
\p
\v 5 There was one man who had endured his illness for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying down, and was aware that he had already been there for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”
\p
\v 7 The sick man replied, “Lord, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, so while I am on my way another person gets in before me.”
\p
\v 8 Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mattress and start walking!”
\p
\v 9 And immediately the man became well; and he picked up his mattress and began walking.
\p Now, that day was a Sabbath.
\v 10 So the Jews said to the healed man, “It is a Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mattress.”
\p
\v 11 He answered them, “He who made me well, that man said to me, ‘Pick up your mattress and walk.’”
\p
\v 12 Then they asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick up your mattress and walk?”
\p
\v 13 But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had quietly slipped away, the place being crowded.
\p
\v 14 Later, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you have become well. Sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you.”
\p
\v 15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
\v 16 Because of this the Jews began persecuting Jesus and seeking to kill him – because he was doing these things on a Sabbath.
\v 17 Jesus declared to them, “My Father is working even now; I too am working.”
\v 18 Then, because of this, the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him – not only because he was breaking the Sabbath, but also because he called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
\p
\v 19 So in response Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you that the Son can do nothing of himself, unless it is something he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, the Son does likewise.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing; and greater works than these he will show him, so that you will marvel.
\v 21 And just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so, in the same way, the Son also gives life to whom he wishes.
\v 22 And the Father judges no one, but has given all judgement to the Son,
\v 23 so that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father. Whoever does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him.
\p
\v 24 Truly, truly, I tell you that the one who listens to my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and does not come to judgement, but has passed from death to life.
\v 25 Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming, and it is here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
\v 26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted to the Son also to have life in himself,
\v 27 and he also gave him authority to execute judgement because he is Son of Man.
\v 28 Do not be amazed by this, because the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice
\v 29 and come out: those who have done good things to a resurrection of life, and those who have done foul things to a resurrection of condemnation.
\v 30 I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge. And my judgement is just because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.”
\p
\v 31 “If I testify about myself, my testimony is not authentic.
\v 32 There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony about me to which he bears witness is authentic.
\v 33 You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
\v 34 But the testimony I receive does not come from a human being. Nevertheless, I say these things so that you may be saved.
\v 35 That man was the lamp, alight and shining, and for a while you were happy to exult in his light.
\v 36 But the testimony I have is greater than John’s, because the labours the Father has entrusted to me to accomplish, the very labours I perform, they testify about me, that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You have never, at any time, heard his voice nor seen what he looks like;
\v 38 and you do not have his word living in you because you do not believe the one whom he has sent.
\p
\v 39 You search the Scriptures because you expect in them to gain eternal life, and it is they that bear witness to me,
\v 40 yet you will not come to me so that you may have life.
\v 41 Among people I receive no honour,
\v 42 but I know you, that in yourselves you do not have the love of God.
\v 43 I have come in my Father’s name, but you do not accept me. If someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.
\v 44 You, how can you believe? – accepting honour from one another yet not seeking the honour which comes from God alone.
\p
\v 45 Do not imagine that I will be accusing you before the Father; the one who is accusing you is Moses – in whom you trust.
\v 46 For if you did believe Moses you would believe me, because he wrote about me.
\v 47 But if you do not believe his written words, how will you believe my spoken words?”
\p
\c 6
\v 1 After this, Jesus went away across the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias,
\v 2 and a large crowd followed him because they were seeing his signs which he was performing on those who were ill.
\v 3 Then Jesus went up onto the mountain and sat there with his disciples.
\v 4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was approaching.
\v 5 Raising his eyes, Jesus saw a large crowd coming towards him. He asked Philip, “Where could we buy bread so that these people can eat?”
\v 6 But he said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was about to do.
\p
\v 7 Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them – so that each of them might receive a small piece.”
\p
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,
\v 9 “There is one little lad here; he has five barley loaves and two fish – but those! What are they among so many?”
\p
\v 10 Jesus said, “Get the people to sit down.” Now there was a lot of grass in the place, so the men sat down – in number, about five thousand.
\v 11 Jesus took the loaves and, having given thanks, he passed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were seated; and in the same way the fish, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 When they were fully satisfied he said to his disciples, “Collect the fragments which are left over so that nothing may be lost.”
\v 13 So they collected – and filled twelve baskets – the fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
\v 14 When the people saw the sign which Jesus had performed they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is coming into the world.”
\v 15 Then Jesus, realising that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, once more withdrew to the mountain, alone.
\p
\v 16 When it was evening his disciples went down to the sea
\v 17 and, getting into the boat, they set off across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark and Jesus had not come back to them.
\v 18 Also, the sea was getting up because a strong wind was blowing.
\v 19 Then, having pushed onwards for three or four miles\f + \fr 6.19: \fk three or for miles: \ft Literally ‘twenty-five or thiry stadia’\f*, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming towards the boat; and they were terrified.
\v 20 But Jesus said to them, “It is I. Do not be afraid.”
\v 21 Then they gladly received him into the boat; and immediately the boat reached the shore to which they were going.
\p
\v 22 The next day the crowd, which was still on the other side of the sea, was aware that there had been no other boat there but one, that in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone off alone.
\v 23 However, other boats came from Tiberias – near the place where they had eaten the bread blessed by the Lord.
\v 24 So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves also got into the boats and left for Capernaum, looking for Jesus.
\v 25 When they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
\p
\v 26 Jesus, replying, said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and were well fed.
\v 27 Do not labour for food which perishes, but for the food which endures for life everlasting which the Son of Man will give to you, for he it is whom God the Father has sealed.”
\p
\v 28 So they said to him, “What should we do to be doing the works of God?”
\p
\v 29 Jesus replied and said to them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”
\p
\v 30 Then they said to him, “So what sign do you give – for us to see and believe in you? What are you accomplishing?
\v 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’\rq Psalms 77[78]:24-25\rq*”
\p
\v 32 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you that Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of God is that which is coming down from heaven and giving life to the world.”
\p
\v 34 Then they said to him, “Lord, give us this bread for evermore.”
\p
\v 35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
\v 36 But I have told you that though you have seen me, yet you do not believe.
\v 37 All whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and those who come to me I will never send away.
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my will, but the will of the one who sent me;
\v 39 and this is the will of the Father who sent me, that I should lose nothing of everything he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.
\v 40 This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.”
\p
\v 41 Then the Jews began murmuring against him because he had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”
\v 42 And they declared, “Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? How then can this man say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’”
\p
\v 43 So Jesus told them, “Do not mutter at each other.
\v 44 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up on the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’\rq Isaiah 54:13\rq* So everyone who is listening to the Father, and learns, comes to me –
\v 46 not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me has everlasting life.
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
\v 50 This is the bread which is coming down from heaven so that whoever eats of it may not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread shall live for ever; and the bread which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”
\p
\v 52 Then the Jews started arguing with one another, saying, “How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?”
\p
\v 53 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you do not have life in you.
\v 54 Those eating my flesh and drinking my blood have everlasting life, and I will raise them up on the last day.
\v 55 For truly my flesh is food, and truly my blood is drink.
\v 56 Those eating my flesh and drinking my blood are living in me, and I in them.
\v 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I am living because of the Father, so whoever is eating me shall likewise be living because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread which has come down from heaven; unlike your ancestors who ate the manna and died, those eating this bread will be living for ever.”
\v 59 He said these things in a synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.
\p
\v 60 Then many of his disciples on hearing this said, “This is a difficult message. Who can listen to him?”
\p
\v 61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were muttering about this, said to them, “Does this offend you?
\v 62 Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
\v 63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no benefit. The words I speak to you are spirit and are life.
\v 64 But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were, those who did not believe and who it was that would betray him,
\v 65 and he said, “This is why I have told you that no one can come to me unless it has been given to him by my Father.”
\p
\v 66 From that [moment] many of his disciples turned back and were no longer following him.
\v 67 So Jesus said to the Twelve, “Do you want to leave too?”
\p
\v 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of everlasting life.
\v 69 We now believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
\p
\v 70 Jesus told them, “Did I not choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.”
\v 71 He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, for he, being one of the Twelve, was intending to betray him.
\p
\c 7
\v 1 After this Jesus was travelling around Galilee, for he did not want to go about in Judea because the Jews were plotting to kill him.
\v 2 The Jewish feast, Tabernacles, was drawing near
\v 3 and his brothers said to him, “Get away from here and go off to Judea so that your disciples can witness your works which you perform,
\v 4 for no one does anything in secret if he wants publicity. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.”
\v 5 For not even his brothers had faith in him.
\p
\v 6 So Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always at hand.
\v 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it, that its works are evil.
\v 8 As for you – go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast because my time has not yet fully come.”
\p
\v 9 Having said this to them, he remained in Galilee.
\v 10 However, when his brothers had gone up, then he too went up to the feast – not openly but, as it were, in private.
\v 11 Now the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and they were asking, “Where is that man?”
\v 12 And there was much whispering among the crowds about him. Some were saying, “He is a good man.” Others were saying, “But no, he is leading the mob astray.”
\v 13 Yet no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews.
\v 14 By this time it was the middle of the feast. Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching,
\v 15 and the Jews were amazed, saying, “How does this man have such knowledge, not being educated?”
\p
\v 16 So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine but his who sent me.
\v 17 Anyone who wants to do his will will recognise whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking for myself.
\v 18 Those who speak for themselves seek their own glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true and there is no unrighteousness in him.
\v 19 Has Moses not given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you want to kill me?”
\p
\v 20 The crowd responded and said, “You have a demon! Who wants to kill you?”
\p
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, “I did one work and you all marvel.
\v 22 This is why Moses gave you circumcision – not that it is from Moses but from the Fathers – and on the Sabbath you circumcise someone.
\v 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I made someone healthy on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge by outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgement.”
\p
\v 25 Then some people from Jerusalem said, “Is this not the one they are seeking to kill?
\v 26 Yet, look! He is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers really know that this is truly the Christ!
\v 27 But we know where this man is from. However, the Christ, when he comes, no one will know where he is from.”
\p
\v 28 Then Jesus called out as he was teaching in the temple, saying, “You both know me and know where I am from. I have come not on my own behest. But he who sent me – whom you do not know – is true.
\v 29 I know him because I am with him, and he sent me.”
\p
\v 30 Then they wanted to arrest him but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come.
\v 31 Many in the crowd believed in him and said, “The Christ, when he comes, will not perform more signs than the ones this man has done.”
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.
\p
\v 33 Then Jesus said, “For a little while longer I shall be with you; then I am going to the one who sent me.
\v 34 You will look for me but you will not find [me]; for where I am, you can not come.”
\p
\v 35 So the Jews said among themselves, “Where is this man intending to go so that we shall not find him? He is not intending to go off to the Greek Diaspora and teach the Greeks is he?
\v 36 What is this thing he has said, ‘You will look for me but you will not find [me]; for where I am, you can not come’?”
\p
\v 37 On the last and greatest day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink.
\v 38 From within the one who believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water shall flow.” 
\v 39 Now he said this about the Spirit whom those believing in him were about to receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet present because Jesus was yet to be glorified.
\p
\v 40 Then many from the crowd listened to the word and said, “This is truly the prophet.”
\v 41 Others said, “This is the Christ.” Others said, “But the Christ does not come from Galilee!
\v 42 No, Scripture has said that from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem – the village where David was – the Christ is coming.”\rq 2 Kingdoms[1 Sam] 7:12; Micah 5:2\rq*
\v 43 So a division arose in the crowd over him.
\v 44 Some wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.
\v 45 Then the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they asked them, “Why have you not brought him?”
\p
\v 46 The officers replied, “No one ever spoke like this man.”
\p
\v 47 Then the Pharisees responded, “Surely you have not been deceived?
\v 48 Have any of the rulers believed in him? Or the Pharisees?
\v 49 But this rabble who do not know the law are accursed.”
\p
\v 50 Nicodemus – he who had come by night to him – being one of the Pharisees, said to them,
\v 51 “Does our law condemn a man without first listening to him and discerning what it is he is doing?”
\p
\v 52 They answered and said to him, “Surely you are not from Galilee too? Search and observe that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”\rq Cf. Isaiah 9:1\rq*
\p
\v 53 Then they left, each to his home.
\p
\c 8
\v 1 Jesus made his way to the Mount of Olives.
\v 2 Then at dawn he appeared once more in the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down and began teaching them.
\v 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught committing adultery, and placing her in the middle
\v 4 they told him, “Teacher, this woman was apprehended in the very act of committing adultery.
\v 5 Now, in our law Moses commanded that this sort of person is to be stoned.\rq Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22\rq* So what do you say?”
\v 6 They said this, testing him, in order to have an accusation against him.
\p But Jesus bent down and began writing on the ground with his finger.
\v 7 Then, while they were continuing to question him, he lifted his head and said to them, “One of you who is sinless – let him be first to throw a stone at her.”
\v 8 And once more, bending down, he continued writing on the ground.
\p
\v 9 Hearing this, they started leaving, one by one, beginning with the older ones. Then  Jesus was left with the woman in the middle.
\v 10 Lifting his head, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
\p
\v 11 She said, “No one, Lord.”
\p Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Be on your way. And from now on, sin no more.”
\p
\v 12 Once again Jesus spoke to them saying, “I am the light of the world. Those who follow me will not be walking in the darkness but will have the light of life.”
\p
\v 13 Then the Pharisees said to him, “You bear witness to yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”
\p
\v 14 Jesus responded and said to them, “Even if I do bear witness to myself, my testimony is valid because I know from where I came and where I am going. But you – you do not know from where I came or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge according to the flesh. I am not judging anyone.
\v 16 And if I do judge, my judgement is valid because it is not only I, but both I and the Father who sent me.
\v 17 And moreover, it is written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.\rq Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15\rq*
\v 18 I am one who bears witness to myself; the Father who sent me also bears witness to me.”
\p
\v 19 Then they asked him, “Where is your father?”
\p Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you did knew me, you would know my Father too.”
\v 20 Jesus spoke these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple, yet no one arrested him because his time had not yet come.
\v 21 Jesus spoke to them once more, “I am going away and you will look for me, but you will die in your sins. Where I am going you cannot come.”
\p
\v 22 So the Jews said, “Will he kill himself? – because he is saying, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’”
\p
\v 23 Then he said to them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
\v 24 That is why I told you that you will die in your sins, for if you do not believe that ‘I am’, you will die in your sins.”
\p
\v 25 So they asked him, “You – who are you?”
\p And Jesus told them, “Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
\v 26 I have much to say about you – and to condemn – for he who sent me is truthful, and what I have heard from him I announce to the world.”
\p
\v 27 They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father,
\v 28 so Jesus said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that ‘I am’. For I do nothing of myself, but according to what my Father has taught me, that is what I proclaim.
\v 29 And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone because I am always doing what is pleasing to him.”
\p
\v 30 As he was relating these things, many believed in him.
\v 31 Now, Jesus said to the Jews who believed him, “If you continue in my word you are truly my disciples
\v 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
\p
\v 33 They answered him, “We are Abraham’s offspring and have never been enslaved to anyone. In what way are you saying, ‘You will become free?’”
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I tell you that everyone committing sin is a slave of sin.
\v 35 A slave does not remain in the house for ever; a son remains for ever.
\v 36 So if the Son makes you free, you will be truly free.
\v 37 I know that you are Abraham’s offspring, yet you want to kill me because my word has no place in you.
\v 38 I speak of what I have experienced with my Father; and likewise, you practise what you have experienced with your father.”
\p
\v 39 They answered and said to him, “Our father is Abraham.”
\p Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children you would be doing Abraham’s deeds.
\v 40 But now, you want to kill me: someone who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.
\v 41 You do the deeds of your father.”
\p So they said to him, “We were not born of fornication. We have one Father – God.”
\p
\v 42 Then Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father you would love me, for I proceeded from God and I have arrived. For I have not come of myself, but he himself has sent me.
\v 43 Why do you not understand when I am speaking? Because you are unable to hear my word.
\v 44 You are from the father – the devil! And you long to practise the evil desires of your father. He was a murderer from the start, and he does not stand by the truth because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie he is speaking in his own [language], for he is a liar, and the father of lies.
\v 45 But because I am telling the truth you do not believe me.
\v 46 Who among you convicts me of sin? Why, then, if I am telling the truth do you not believe me?
\v 47 Those who are of God hear what God is saying. This is why you do not hear – because you are not of God.”
\p
\v 48 Then the Jews answered and said to him, “Are we not right to say that you are a Samaritan – and have a demon?”
\p
\v 49 Jesus responded, “I do not have a demon, but I am honouring my Father. And you are dishonouring me.
\v 50 Though I am not seeking my own glory there is one who is seeking [it] – and is avenging.
\v 51 Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever keeps my word will never experience death.”
\p
\v 52 Then the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died – and the prophets – yet you are saying, ‘whoever keeps my word will never experience death’!
\v 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died. Who are you making yourself out to be?”
\p
\v 54 Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who is glorifying me, of whom you say that he is your God.
\v 55 You have not known him, but I know him. If I said that I do not know him I would be, like you, a liar. But I do know him and I keep his word.
\v 56 Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he might see my day. He saw, and was glad.”
\p
\v 57 So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old – yet you have seen Abraham!”
\p
\v 58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, before Abraham came to be, ‘I am’.”
\p
\v 59 Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus concealed himself and left the temple, going through the middle of them and thus departing.
\p
\c 9
\v 1 As he was passing by he saw a man blind from birth,
\v 2 and his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who has sinned – this man, or his parents – that he was born blind?”
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered, “Neither he nor his parents – but so that the works of God might be revealed in him.
\v 4 I must accomplish the works of the one who sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one is able to work.
\v 5 While I am in the world I am the world’s light.”
\v 6 Saying these things, he spat on the ground and made mud from the saliva, and smeared the mud on the eyes of the blind man.
\v 7 Then he said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” – which means ‘Sent’. So he went and washed and came back seeing.
\v 8 Now, the neighbours and those who had seen him previously [who knew] that he was blind said, “Is this not he who sits and begs?”
\v 9 Others were saying, “This is he”; yet others, “He looks like him.”
\p The man himself was saying, “I am he!”
\v 10 So the people asked him, “How were your eyes opened?”
\p
\v 11 The man answered and said, “A man called Jesus made mud and smeared my eyes and told me, “Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.” When I went and washed I could see again.”
\p
\v 12 Then they said him, “Where is this man?”
\p He replied, “I do not know.”
\p
\v 13 They brought him – who once had been blind – to the Pharisees.
\v 14 It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
\v 15 So now the Pharisees began questioning him about how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes and I washed and I can see.”
\p
\v 16 Then some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was division among them.
\v 17 They spoke to the blind man once again, “What do you say about him? Because [it was] your eyes he opened.”
\p He said, “He is a prophet.”
\p
\v 18 But the Jews did not believe him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they had spoken to the parents of the one who had received his sight.
\v 19 They asked them, saying, “Is this your son – of whom you say that he was born blind? So how does he now see?”
\p
\v 20 His parents responded by saying, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
\v 21 but how he now sees, we do not know; and who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He himself shall speak for himself.”
\v 22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged him as Christ would be expelled from the synagogue.
\v 23 Because of this his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”
\p
\v 24 So they called the man who had been blind a second time and said to him, “Give God the glory. We know that this man is a sinner.”
\p
\v 25 The man then replied and said, “Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know: that, having been blind, I now see.”
\p
\v 26 Again they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
\p
\v 27 He answered them, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear [it] again? Do you too want to become his disciples?”
\p
\v 28 They reviled him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but this man! We do not know where he comes from.”
\p
\v 30 The man answered and said to them, “Why, this is a wonder! You do not know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes!
\v 31 Now we know that God does not listen to sinners; but if someone is reverent towards God and does his will, to him God will listen.
\v 32 Through the ages there is no report of anyone having opened the eyes of one born blind.
\v 33 If this man were not from God he would not be able to do anything.”
\p
\v 34 They responded by saying to him, “You were born in utter sin – yet you would teach us!” Then they threw him out.
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him he said to him, “Do you believe in the Son of God?”
\p
\v 36 The man answered and said, “And who is he, Lord, so that I might believe in him?”
\p
\v 37 Jesus told him, “You have already seen him, for the one speaking to you is he.”
\p
\v 38 Then he declared, “Lord, I believe!” And he bowed down to him.
\p
\v 39 Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgement, so that those who do not see, might see; and that those who do see, might become blind.”
\p
\v 40 When those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things they asked him, “Surely we are not blind as well?”
\p
\v 41 Jesus told them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you are saying, ‘We see’, and so your sin endures.”
\p
\c 10
\v 1 “Truly, truly, I tell you, the one who does not enter by the gate to the sheepfold but climbs in some other way, that person is a thief and a rustler.
\v 2 The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 To him the gatekeeper opens and the sheep hear his voice. The shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
\v 4 And when he brings out his own sheep he walks in front of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
\v 5 They will never follow strangers, but will run away from them because they do not recognise the voice of strangers.”
\v 6 Jesus told them this parable but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
\p
\v 7 So Jesus spoke to them once more, “Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the Gate for the sheep.
\v 8 All those who have come before me are thieves and rustlers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
\v 9 I am the Gate. Anyone who enters through me will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture.
\v 10 The thief only comes to steal, to kill and to destroy. I came so they might have life, and have it in abundance.”
\p
\v 11 “I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
\v 12 The hired hand, not being a shepherd and not owning the sheep, abandons the sheep when he sees the wolf coming and runs away; and the wolf carries off the sheep and scatters them.
\v 13 The hired hand, because he is a hired hand, runs away. He does not care about the sheep.
\v 14 I am the Good Shepherd. I know my own and I am known by those who are mine,
\v 15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 I have other sheep, not of this fold. I must fetch them too. They will listen to my voice and there will be one flock, one Shepherd.
\v 17 This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take up it again.
\v 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”
\p
\v 19 So once again there was a division of opinion among the Jews because of these words.
\v 20 Many of them said, “He has a demon and he is raving. Why do you listen to him?”
\v 21 Others said, “These are not the sayings of someone demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
\p
\v 22 It was [the Feast of] the Dedication in Jerusalem and it was winter,
\v 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s colonnade.
\v 24 So the Jews gathered around him and asked him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
\p
\v 25 Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness to me.
\v 26 But you do not believe because you are not among my sheep, as I have told you.
\v 27 The sheep who are mine listen to my voice and I know them, and they follow me.
\v 28 And I give to them life everlasting so they shall never ever perish; and no one shall snatch them from my hand.
\v 29 My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, so no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand.
\v 30 I and the Father are one.”
\p
\v 31 So once more the Jews picked up stones in order to stone him.
\v 32 Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which work among these are you stoning me?”
\p
\v 33 The Jews answered him saying, “We are not stoning you for a good work but for blasphemy; and because you, a human being, are making yourself out to be God.”
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said you are gods?’\rq Psalms 81[82]:6\rq*
\v 35 If he called them gods, those to whom the word of God came – and Scripture can not be rescinded –
\v 36 [how can] you say of him whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?
\v 37 If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me;
\v 38 but if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works so that you might recognise and believe that the Father is in me and I in him.”
\p
\v 39 Then once more they wanted to seize him, but he escaped from their hand
\v 40 and went off again to the far side Jordan, to the place where John first began baptizing, and he stayed there.
\v 41 Many came to him and were saying, “Although John performed no sign, absolutely everything John said about this man is true.”
\v 42 And many believed in him there.
\p
\c 11
\v 1 Now, someone was ill – Lazarus of Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
\v 2 It was Mary who anointed the Lord with oil and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was ill.
\v 3 So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.”
\v 4 But when Jesus heard, he said, “This illness is not to death but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified through it.”
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus,
\v 6 yet, when he heard that he was ill, he actually stayed where he was for two days.
\v 7 After that he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”
\p
\v 8 The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews have just been trying to stone you, and you go there again?”
\p
\v 9 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If people walk in the day they do not stumble because they see the light of this world.
\v 10 But if people walk in the night they stumble because the light is not about them.”
\v 11 He said these things and then told them, “Lazarus, our friend, has fallen asleep; but I am making the journey so that I might wake him up.”
\p
\v 12 Then the disciples said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep he will recover.”
\p
\v 13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died.
\v 15 I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”
\p
\v 16 Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to the other disciples, “Yes, let us go so that we can die with him.”
\p
\v 17 When Jesus arrived he found that he had already been in the tomb for four days.
\v 18 Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles\f \fr 11:18 \ft Literally ‘fifteen stadia’ – approximately 1.75 miles\f* away,
\v 19 and many of the Jews had come to those with Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Then, when Martha heard that Jesus was arriving, she went to meet him; but Mary stayed at home.
\v 21 Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.
\v 22 But even now, I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.”
\v 23 Jesus told her, “Your brother will rise again.”
\p
\v 24 Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”
\p
\v 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even if they die, shall live.
\v 26 And all who live and believe in me shall never die. Do you believe this?”
\p
\v 27 She answered, “Yes, truly, Lord. It is my belief that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.”
\p
\v 28 When she had said this she went off and called her sister Mary, privately, saying, “The Teacher is here and is calling you.”
\v 29 When she heard this she got up quickly and went to him.
\v 30 Jesus had not yet reached the village but was at the place where Martha had met him.
\v 31 So the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, seeing Mary get up quickly and go out, followed her saying, “She is going to the tomb so that she can weep there.”
\v 32 When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.”
\p
\v 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, he groaned in spirit and was deeply moved.
\v 34 He asked, “Where have you laid him?”
\p They told him, “Lord, come and see.”
\p
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\p
\v 36 Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him.”
\v 37 Some of them said, “Was he who opened the eyes of the blind man not able to act so that this man did not die?”
\p
\v 38 Jesus, again groaning within himself, went to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was placed against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”
\p The sister of the dead man, Martha, said to him, “Lord, by this time he will stink for it is the fourth day.”
\p
\v 40 Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”
\p
\v 41 So they took the stone away from where the dead man had been laid, and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
\v 42 I know that you always hear me, but because of the crowd standing all around I said this, so that they may believe that you sent me.”
\v 43 After saying this he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus! Come out!”
\p
\v 44 Then he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes and with a cloth wrapped around his face.
\p Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.”
\v 45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus had done believed in him.
\v 46 But some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
\v 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we to do? For this man is performing many signs.
\v 48 If we leave him be like this, everyone will believe in him, then the Romans will come and take away both our position and our nation.”
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing.
\v 50 Do you not think that it is better for us that one man should die on behalf of the people so the whole nation might not perish?”
\v 51 He did not say this on his own [initiative], but being High Priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation
\v 52 – and not only for the nation, but so that he might also bring together as one the scattered children of God.
\v 53 So from that day they conspired to kill him.
\v 54 Therefore Jesus was no longer going about openly among the Jews, but he left that place for the region close to the desert, for a town called Ephraim, and he stayed there with his disciples.
\p
\v 55 It was close to the Passover of the Jews, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves.
\v 56 And they were looking for Jesus, and were standing in the temple saying to one another, “What do you think? That he might not come to the feast?”
\v 57 Both the chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order that if anyone knew where he was it must be reported so that they might arrest him.
\p
\c 12
\v 1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was – he who had died, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made supper for him there. Martha was serving and Lazarus was one of those sitting down with him.
\v 3 Then Mary, taking a pound of very expensive perfumed oil of pure spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
\v 4 But one of his disciples – Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, who was about to betray him – said,
\v 5 “Why was this oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief; he had the money bag and was taking out what was put in.
\v 7 Then Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
\v 8 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”
\p
\v 9 Now a large crowd of the Jews were aware that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus sake, but also so that they might see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 Now the chief priests resolved to kill Lazarus as well,
\v 11 because on his account many of the Jews were going over and believing in Jesus.
\p
\v 12 On the next day a great crowd of those who had come to the feast, having heard that Jesus had come to Jerusalem,
\v 13 took palm branches and went out to meet him. They were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord, King of Israel!”\rq Psalms 117[118]:25-26\rq*
\p
\v 14 Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,
\q1
\v 15 ‘Do not be afraid, daughter of Sion. Look! – your King is coming, sitting on a foal of a donkey.’\rq Zechariah 9:9\rq*
\m
\p
\v 16 His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him, and that they had done these things to him.
\v 17 Now the crowds which were with him were testifying that he had called Lazarus from the tomb and had raised him from the dead.
\v 18 It was also for this reason that the crowds went with him, because they had heard that he had performed this sign.
\v 19 So the Pharisees said among themselves, “You see how this is accomplishing nothing? Look! The world has gone after him!”
\p
\v 20 Now, among those coming up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.
\v 21 They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee and said to him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”
\v 22 Philip went and told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
\v 23 Jesus responded, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I tell you that unless a grain of wheat, falling to the ground, dies, it remains a single [grain], but if it dies it bears much fruit.
\v 25 Those who love their life will lose it; those who hate their life in this world will keep it for ever.
\v 26 If any want to serve me, let them follow me. Where I am, there my servant will be also. If any want to serve me, the Father will honour them.
\p
\v 27 Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour?’ But this is why I have come to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify your name.”
\p Then a voice came from heaven saying, “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.”
\p
\v 29 The crowd standing nearby, hearing it, said that it was thunder; others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”
\p
\v 30 Jesus responded by saying, “This voice has come, not for my sake but for yours.
\v 31 Now judgement is upon this world. Now the ruler of this world shall be driven out.
\v 32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to myself.”
\v 33 Now he said this signifying what kind of death he would die.
\v 34 The crowd said to him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever,\rq Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 2:44; but cf. Isaiah 53:8\rq* so why do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus told them, “For a little longer the light will be with you; walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness do not know where they are going.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become children of light.”
\p Having said these things, Jesus went away and was hidden from them.
\p
\v 37 He performed so many signs in their presence, yet they did not believe in him.
\v 38 This was to fulfil the words of Isaiah the prophet who said,
\q1 ‘Lord, who has believed our preaching?
\q1 And the arm of the Lord – to whom has it been revealed?’\rq Isaiah 53:1\rq*
\m
\v 39 This is why they could not believe, as Isaiah said elsewhere,
\q1
\v 40 ‘He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart
\q1 so that they might not see with their eyes or understand with their heart,
\q1 and turn back so that I might heal them.’\rq Isaiah 6:10\rq*
\m
\v 41 Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke about him.
\v 42 Even so, many of the rulers did believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not admit it so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue,
\v 43 for they loved the respect of human beings more than the respect of God.
\p
\v 44 Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in the one who sent me.
\v 45 And whoever sees me, sees the one who sent me.
\v 46 I have come as a light to the world so that all who believe in me may not remain in darkness.
\v 47 If any listen to my sayings and do not believe, I do not judge them, for I came, not that I might judge the world but that I might save the world.
\v 48 Those who reject me and do not accept my sayings have a judge: what I have said, that is what will judge them on the last day,
\v 49 because I have not spoken for myself; but the Father who sent me has given me a commandment about what I should say and what I should preach.
\v 50 And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore I say what the Father has told me – that is what I say.”
\p
\c 13
\v 1 Before the feast of the Passover Jesus knew that his hour had arrived to go from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.
\v 2 When it was time for supper the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, [son] of Simon Iscariot, to betray him.
\v 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given everything to him, into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God,
\v 4 rose from supper and layed aside his clothes; and, taking a towel, he wrapped it around him.
\v 5 Next he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel which was wrapped around him.
\v 6 Then he came to Simon Peter, and that [disciple] asked him, “Lord, are you yourself washing my feet?”
\p
\v 7 Jesus replied, saying to him, “You do not see now what I am doing, but you will understand later.”
\p
\v 8 Peter told him, “You are not washing my feet – not ever!”
\p Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you do not belong to me.”
\p
\v 9 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”
\p
\v 10 Jesus told him, “Those who have been made clean need only wash their feet, for they are completely clean – and you are clean, but not all of you.”
\v 11 For he knew the one who was betraying him; that is why he said, “You are not all clean.”
\v 12 Then, when he had washed their feet and taken his clothes, he sat down once more and said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?
\v 13 You call me, ‘The Teacher’ and ‘The Lord’, and you say rightly because I am.
\v 14 So if I, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you, too, should wash one another’s feet.
\v 15 I have given you an example so that, just as I have done for you, you might do too. 
\v 16 Truly, truly, I tell you, a servant is not greater than the master, nor is an apostle greater than the one who sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things you are blessed – if you do them.
\v 18 I am not speaking about all of you. I know those whom I have chosen for myself, but let the Scripture be fulfilled, ‘The one who is eating bread with me has raised his heel against me.’\rq Psalms 40[41]:9\rq*
\v 19 From now on I shall tell you before it happens, so that when it happens you might believe that I AM.
\v 20 Truly, truly, I tell you, the one who receives those whom I send, receives me; and the one who receives me, receives him who sent me.”
\p
\v 21 After saying these things Jesus was troubled in spirit and bore witness, saying, “Truly, truly, I tell you that one of you will betray me.”
\p
\v 22 Then the disciples began looking at one another, wondering about whom he was speaking.
\v 23 There was one among his disciples, one whom Jesus loved, reclining close to Jesus’ breast.
\v 24 So Simon Peter nodded to this man to inquire of whom he was speaking,
\v 25 and he, leaning back on Jesus’ breast, asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered, “When I have dipped this piece of bread, it is the one to whom I give it.” And when he had dipped the bread he gave it to Judas, [son] of Simon Iscariot.
\v 27 And after the bread Satan entered into him.
\p Then Jesus told him, “What you do, do quickly.”
\p
\v 28 Now, none at those at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him,
\v 29 but some were thinking that, because Judas had the money bag, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 And so, accepting the bread, that man went out at once, and it was night.
\p
\v 31 Then, when he had left, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.
\v 32 If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself. Yes, he will glorify him very soon.
\v 33 Little ones, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me, but, just as I told the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come,’ I am now telling you too.
\v 34 I am giving you a new commandment – that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, so you should love one another.
\v 35 Everyone will know that you are my disciples by this – that you have love for one another.”
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?”
\p Jesus answered him, “Where I myself am going, you cannot now follow, but eventually you will follow me.”
\p
\v 37 Peter asked him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
\p
\v 38 Jesus answered him, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I tell you; no cock shall crow until you have disowned me three times.”
\p
\c 14
\v 1 “Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God and believe in me.
\v 2 In my Father’s house are many places to live, otherwise I should have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you,
\v 3 and when I have gone and prepared a place for you I am coming back again, and I shall take you to myself so that where I am you may be too.
\v 4 Now you know where I am going and you know the way.”
\p
\v 5 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going so how can we know the way?”
\p
\v 6 Jesus said to him, “I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
\v 7 If you had known me, you would have known my Father too. But from this time on you do know him and you are looking at him.”
\p
\v 8 Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father and that will satisfy us!”
\p
\v 9 Jesus said to him, “I have been with you for quite a while, Philip, yet you not know me. The one who has seen me has seen the Father, so what do you mean by saying, ‘Show us the Father’?
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father who is in me is doing the work.
\v 11 Believe me, that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or else believe me because of the works themselves.
\v 12 Truly, truly, I tell you, those who believe in me will also produce the works that I am performing; and they will do greater works than these because I am going to my Father.
\v 13 So if you ask anything in my name, this I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 Whatever you ask in my name I will do.
\v 15 If you love me, keep my commandments,
\v 16 and I shall ask the Father who will give you another advocate to be with you for ever
\v 17 – the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you do know him because he is present with you and will be in you.
\v 18 I will not leave you fatherless; I am coming to you.
\v 19 A little longer and the world sees me no more. But you continue to see me. Because I live, you too shall live.
\v 20 On that day you will understand, because I [am] in my Father and you in me and I in you.
\v 21 Those who possess my commandments and keep them, they are the ones who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father; and I shall love and reveal myself to them.”
\p
\v 22 Judas – not Iscariot – asked him, “Lord, so what has happened that you intend to reveal yourself to us, but not to the world?”
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered him, “Those who love me will hold fast to my word; my Father will love them, and we shall come to them and make a place to live in them.
\v 24 Those who do not love me do not hold fast to my words, though the word which you hear is not mine, but is the Father’s who sent me.
\v 25 These things I have said to you, being present with you.
\v 26 The Advocate, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you everything and remind you of everything I said to you.”
\p
\v 27 “Peace I am leaving with you; my peace I am giving to you; I am giving to you not in the way the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.
\v 28 You have heard me say to you, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me you would have rejoiced that I said ‘I am going to the Father’, for my Father is greater than I.
\v 29 Now, I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe.
\v 30 I will not longer speak much with you because the ruler of the world is coming, though he has nothing on me;
\v 31 but what I do is in accordance with what the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Get up. Let us be going.”
\p
\c 15
\v 1 “I am the true vine and my Father is the vine-grower.
\v 2 Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he removes; and every one bearing fruit, he prunes so that it may bear more fruit.
\v 3 You are already ‘pruned’ through the word I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Remain in me and I in you. Just as the branch itself is unable to bear fruit unless it remains in the vine, so neither [can] you unless you remain in me.
\v 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me and I in them bear much fruit; though independently of me you are unable to do anything.
\v 6 Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown out like a branch and dries up. Then they are gathered and thrown on the fire and burnt.
\v 7 If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish and it shall happen for you.”
\p
\v 8 “In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.
\v 9 As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Remain in my love.
\v 10 If you keep my commandments you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
\v 11 I have told you these things so that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be complete”
\p
\v 12 “This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you.
\v 13 No one has greater love than this, that someone should give his life for his friends.
\v 14 You are my friends if you do what I command you.
\v 15 No longer do I call you servants, because the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I call you friends, because everything I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.
\v 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you; and I appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit and your fruit might endure; so that whatever you might ask the Father in my name he might give you.”
\p
\v 17 “These things I command you, that you love one another.”
\p
\v 18 “If the world hates you, you know that it hated me first.
\v 19 If you were of the world the world would love its own, but because you are not of the world, indeed I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.
\v 20 Remember what I told you, ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
\v 21 Indeed, they will do all these things to you because of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\v 23 The one who hates me also hates my Father.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works which no one else has done they would not have sin, but now that they have seen, they have hated both me and my Father
\v 25 so that the word which was written in their law might be fulfilled, ‘They hated me for no reason.’”\rq Psalms 34[35]:19; 68[69]:4\rq*
\p
\v 26 “When the Advocate comes whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he is the one who will testify about me.
\v 27 You too will testify because, from the first, you are with me.”
\p
\c 16
\v 1 “I have told you these things so that you may not be made to stumble.
\v 2 They will expel you from the synagogues. Indeed, the time is coming when those who kill you will think that they are offering worship to God.
\v 3 But they will do these things because they do not know the Father or me.
\v 4 Therefore I have told you these things so that when the hour comes you might remember what I have told you. I did not tell you these things at first because I was with you,
\v 5 but now I am going away to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
\v 6 But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
\v 7 However, I am telling you the truth. It is better for you that I go away, for if I do not go away the Advocate will not come to you. But if I do go, I shall send him to you.
\v 8 And when he has come he will rebuke the world about sin and about righteousness and about judgement:
\v 9 about sin, certainly, because they do not believe in me;
\v 10 and about righteousness because I am going to my Father and you will no longer see me;
\v 11 and about judgement because the ruler of this world has been judged.”
\p
\v 12 “I still have many things to say to you, but you are unable to cope with them now.
\v 13 But when he, the Spirit of Truth, has come he will guide you into the whole truth for he will not speak from himself, but he will say whatever he hears. And he will tell you what is to come.
\v 14 He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and will declare it to you.
\v 15 Everything, all that the Father has, is mine. This is why I said that he will take what is mine and will declare it to you.
\v 16 For a short while you do not see me; then again for a short while, you will see me. Because I am going away to the Father.”
\p
\v 17 Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this he is telling us, ‘For a short while you do not see me; then again for a short while, you will see me’ and ‘because I am going away to the Father?’”
\v 18 Then they started asking, “What is this that he is saying, ‘For a short while’? We do not understand what he is saying.”
\p
\v 19 Now, Jesus knew that they were wanting to ask him, so he said to them, “Is this what you are enquiring about among yourselves – that I said, ‘For a short while you do not see me; then again for a short while, you will see me’?
\v 20 Truly, truly, I tell you that you will weep and wail but the world will rejoice. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.
\v 21 When a woman is in labour she suffers distress because her time has come, but when she gives birth to the child she does not remember the anguish for joy that a human being has been born into the world.
\v 22 So you are indeed grieving now, but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice. And your joy, no one takes from you.
\p
\v 23 Then, on that day you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I tell you, whatever you might ask of the Father in my name he will give you.
\v 24 Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
\v 25 I have told you these things using figures of speech. But a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you using figures of speech, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.
\v 26 On that day you will make a request in my name – but I am not saying to you that I shall ask the Father for you,
\v 27 for the Father himself loves you because you have come to love me, and have come to believe that I came from God.
\v 28 I have come from the Father’s side, and I have come into the world. I am leaving the world again and going to the Father.”
\p
\v 29 His disciples said to him, “See, now you are speaking plainly, for you are using no figures of speech.
\v 30 Now we understand that you know everything, so you have no need for anyone to ask you. Because of this we believe that you have come from God.”
\p
\v 31 Jesus replied them, “Now do you believe?
\v 32 Listen! A time is coming – and it has now arrived – when you will be scattered – each to their own – and you will leave me on my own. But I am not alone because the Father is with me.
\v 33 I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have trouble; but, courage! I have conquered the world!”
\p
\c 17
\v 1 Jesus said these things, then raising his eyes to heaven he said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that your Son may also glorify you.
\v 2 As it is, you have given him authority over all flesh so that he will give everlasting life to all whom you have given to him.
\p
\v 3 And this is everlasting life, that they might know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent, Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 4 I have glorified you on the earth; the work which you gave me to do I have accomplished.
\v 5 And now, Father, glorify me with yourself, with the glory I had at your side before the world came to be.
\v 6 I have revealed your name to the men and women whom you have given to me from the world. They were yours, and to me you have given them. They have kept your word.
\v 7 Now they have come to understand that everything, all you that you gave me, is from you;
\v 8 because the things you gave me to say I have given to them. They have accepted them and truly understand that I have come from your side; and they believe that you sent me.
\v 9 I pray for them; I pray, not for the world, but for those whom you have given to me, for they are yours.
\v 10 All [that is] mine is yours, and yours, mine; and I have been glorified in them.
\v 11 And I am no longer in the world – but they are in the world – for I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them safe, those whom you have given to me, for the sake of your name. So that they, like us, may be one.
\v 12 While I was with them in the world I was keeping them safe for the sake of your name. Those whom you gave to me I guarded, and none of them was lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I am coming to you, and I say these things in the world so that they may have my joy filling them.
\v 14 I have given them your word, and the world hates them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
\v 15 I do not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you might protect them from the evil one.
\v 16 They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.
\v 18 Just as you have sent me into the world, I have also sent them into the world,
\v 19 and for their sake I sanctify myself so that they too may be sanctified in truth.
\v 20 I do not pray only for these, but also for those who believe in me because of what they say,
\v 21 that they may all be one, just as you, Father, in me, and I in you; that they also may be one in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
\v 22 And the glory which you have given to me, I have given to them so that they may be one, just as we are one;
\v 23 I in them, and you in me; that they may be completely one so that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them just as you have loved me.
\v 24 Father, I want those whom you have given me to be where I am, with me, so that they may see the glory which you gave to me because you have loved me from before the foundation of the world.
\v 25 Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, yet I know you, and these know that you have sent me.
\v 26 Yes, I have made your name known to them and I will make it known, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”
\p
\c 18
\v 1 Saying these things, Jesus went out with his disciples beyond the Kedron gully where there was a garden into which he entered, he and his disciples.
\v 2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples.
\p
\v 3 So Judas, taking the cohort of soldiers with officials from the chief priests and of the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
\v 4 And Jesus, knowing everything that was to happen to him, stepped forward and said to them, “For whom are you searching?”
\p
\v 5 They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
\p Jesus said to them, “I AM.”
\p Judas who betrayed him was also there with them.
\v 6 Now, when he said to them, ‘I AM’, they backed off and fell to the ground.
\v 7 So Jesus asked them once more, “For whom are you searching?”
\p And they replied, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
\p
\v 8 Jesus responded, “I have told you that I AM. If you are looking for me, then let these go.”
\v 9 This was to fulfil what he had said, ‘Of those whom you have given to me, I have lost none.’
\p
\v 10 Then Simon Peter who had a sword, drew it and struck the High Priest’s servant and cut off his ear, the right one. The servant’s name was Malchus.
\v 11 But Jesus told Peter, “Put the sword back in [its] sheath. Am I not to drink the cup which the Father has given me?”
\p
\v 12 So the cohort and the military commander and the officials from the Jews seized Jesus and bound him.
\v 13 Then they led him away, first to Annas – because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.
\v 14 It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better that one man should die on behalf the people.
\p
\v 15 Following Jesus were Simon Peter and another disciple. Now, that disciple was known to the High Priest, so he went in with Jesus into the High Priest’s courtyard.
\v 16 But Peter was standing beside the door, outside. So the other disciple – who was known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the woman on the door, and brought Peter in.
\v 17 Then the girl, the door-keeper, asked Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”
\p He said, “I am not.”
\p
\v 18 The servants and officials standing there had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves; and Peter was standing with them, warming himself.
\p
\v 19 Then the High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus replied to him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple where the Jews congregate at all times. I said nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard what I said to them. Look, these people know what I said.”
\p
\v 22 When Jesus said this one of the officials standing there gave him a slap, saying, “Is this how you reply to the High Priest?”
\p
\v 23 Jesus replied to him, “If I have spoken wrongly, charge [me] with the wrong; but if [I have spoken] honestly, why do you hit me?”
\p
\v 24 Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the High Priest.
\p
\v 25 Now, Simon Peter was standing there warming himself. They said to him, “Are you not also one of his disciples?”
\p He denied it and said, “I am not.”
\p
\v 26 One of the servants of the High Priest who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”
\p
\v 27 And again Peter denied it. And immediately a cock crowed.
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early in the morning, and they themselves did not go into the Praetorium in order not to be made unclean so that they might eat the Passover.
\v 29 Pilate therefore went out to them and asked, “What charge are bringing against this man?”
\p
\v 30 In reply they said to him, “If he were not a criminal we would not have committed him to you.”
\p
\v 31 So Pilate told them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”
\p But the Jews replied to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”
\v 32 This was to fulfil Jesus’ statement which he had made indicating the kind of death by which he was about to die.
\p
\v 33 So Pilate went back into the Praetorium and, calling Jesus, he said to him, “You are the King of the Jews?”
\p
\v 34 Jesus replied to him, “Are you yourself saying this – or have others told you about me?”
\p
\v 35 Pilate responded, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your people – yes, the chief priests – have handed you over to me. What have you done?”
\p
\v 36 Jesus answered, “My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, my attendants would have fought so that I might not be surrendered to the Jews. But as it is, my Kingdom is not from here.”
\p
\v 37 Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king!”
\p Jesus replied, “You have said that I am a king. I was born for this, and and I came into the world for this, that I might testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the Truth listens to my voice.”
\p
\v 38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”
\p And having said this he went out once more to the Jews and told them, “I find no case against him.
\v 39 But you have a custom that I should release someone for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”
\p
\v 40 But they all shouted back, saying, “Not this man but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a brigand.
\p
\c 19
\v 1 Accordingly Pilate then had Jesus taken away and flogged,
\v 2 and the soldiers plaited a crown from thorns, placed [it] on his head, and invested him in a purple robe.
\v 3 And they were saying, “Hail, King of the Jews” and they were slapping him with their hands.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate went outside again and said to them, “Look! I am bringing him out to you so that you might know that I find no case against him.”
\p
\v 5 So Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and he said to them, “Behold! The man!”
\p
\v 6 Now when the chief priests and the officers saw him they shouted out, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”
\p Pilate told them, “You take him and you crucify him, for I find no case against him.”
\p
\v 7 The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to our law he should die, because he made himself Son of God.”
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate heard these words he was even more afraid,
\v 9 and going back into the Praetorium he asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no response.
\v 10 Then Pilate said to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Are you not aware that I have authority to crucify you and I have authority to release you?”
\p
\v 11 Jesus replied, “You would have no authority over me at all if it had not been given to you from above. That is why the one who handed me over to you has greater guilt.”
\p
\v 12 From then on, Pilate endeavoured to release him, but the Jews were shouting out, saying, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend. Everyone who makes himself king is rejecting Caesar.”
\p
\v 13 Then Pilate, on hearing these words, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on the bench at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\v 14 Now it was about the sixth hour on the Day of Preparation for the Passover, and he said to the Jews, “Behold, your king!”
\p
\v 15 But they shouted out, “Away! Away [with him]! Crucify him!”
\p Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your king?”
\p The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”
\p
\v 16 So then he handed him over to them to be crucified. They took Jesus and led [him] away.
\v 17 Then, lifting up his cross, he went out to what is called The Place of a Skull – which in Hebrew is named Golgotha –
\v 18 where they crucified him; and with him were two others on either side with Jesus in the middle.
\v 19 And Pilate wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, ‘Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.’
\v 20 Now many of the Jews read this inscription because the place where Jesus was crucified was close to the city, and it had been written in Hebrew, Greek, [and] Latin.
\v 21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews’ but ‘This man said, “I am King of the Jews”.’”
\p
\v 22 Pilate replied, “What I have written I have written.”
\p
\v 23 Then, when the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his clothes and made four lots, a share for each soldier; then the cloak. But the cloak was seamless, the whole thing woven from the top.
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Let us not tear it, but let us draw for it – [to decide] whose it will be.” So the Scripture was fulfilled. It says,
\q1 ‘They divided my clothes among them
\q1 and for my garment they threw dice.’\rq Psalms 21[22]:18\rq*
\m And this is exactly what the soldiers did.
\v 25 Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 Then, when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, look! Your son!”
\v 27 Next he said to the disciple, “Look! Your mother!” And from that moment the disciple took her as his own.
\p
\v 28 After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished [and] so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”\rq See Psalms 21[22]:16\rq*
\v 29 Now a jar full of sour wine had been provided, so they filled a sponge with the sour wine and, putting [it] around a hyssop [stalk], they held it up to his mouth.
\v 30 Then when Jesus had received the sour wine he said, “It has been accomplished.” And bowing his head, he gave up [his] spirit.
\p
\v 31 Then, since it was the Day of Preparation, in order that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath – for that Sabbath was an important day – the Jews asked Pilate that the legs might be broken, and that they might be removed.
\v 32 So it was that the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first, and then the other, of those crucified with him.
\v 33 But coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs.
\v 34 However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.
\v 35 Now he who witnessed [it] has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you too may believe.
\v 36 For these things took place so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘Not a bone of him shall be broken.’\rq Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12; Psalms 33[34]:20\rq*
\v 37 And again, another Scripture says, ‘They shall look upon the one they pierced.’\rq Zechariah 12:10\rq*
\p
\v 38 After this, Joseph of Arimathaea who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he might remove the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave his permission. So he then went and took away Jesus’ body.
\v 39 Nicodemus also went – he who had previously gone to Jesus by night – bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
\v 40 Then they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices for burial, as was the custom of the Jews.
\v 41 In the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
\v 42 So, because of the Day of Preparation for the Jews, because the tomb was nearby, there they laid Jesus.
\p
\c 20
\v 1 On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and she saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb.
\v 2 Then she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have put him.”
\p
\v 3 So Peter and the other disciple set off and were approaching the tomb
\v 4 with the two running together, but the other disciple was running faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first.
\v 5 And, stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
\v 6 Then Simon Peter appeared, following him. And he went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there;
\v 7 but the towel that had been on his head was not lying with the linen cloths, but sparately, folded up in its own place.
\v 8 Only then did the other disciple who had arrived at the tomb first also go in. And he saw; and he believed.
\v 9 For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he had to rise again from the dead.
\v 10 Then the disciples left for their own homes.
\p
\v 11 But Mary remained near the tomb, weeping outside. As she was crying she leant into the tomb,
\v 12 and she saw two angels in white, seated – one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been laid.
\v 13 And they spoke to her. “Woman, why are you weeping?”
\p She told them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.”
\v 14 Saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? For whom are you searching?”
\p She, thinking he was the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have moved him, tell me where you have put him and I will take him away.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.”
\p Turning, she said to him, “Rabbouni!” that is to say, “Teacher!”
\p
\v 17 Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and sisters and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.’”
\p
\v 18 Mary Magdalene appeared, bringing the news to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
\p
\v 19 It was the evening of that day, the first day of the week, and where the disciples were gathered the doors were locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”
\p
\v 20 When he had said this he showed them his hands and his side, and the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.
\v 21 Once again Jesus said, “Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you.”
\v 22 Saying this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 23 If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone’s, they are retained.”
\p
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the Twelve who is called ‘the Twin’, was not with them when Jesus came.
\v 25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”
\p But he answered them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
\p
\v 26 Again, eight days later, his disciples were inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus appeared – the doors had been locked – and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”
\v 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Lay your finger here and look at my hands; then move your hand and put it into my side. Do not become an unbeliever, but a believer.”
\p
\v 28 Thomas responded and said to him, “My Lord and my God.”
\p
\v 29 Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen yet have believed.”
\p
\v 30 Now Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book.
\v 31 But these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing, you may have life in his name.
\p
\c 21
\v 1 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the sea of Tiberias. He appeared in this way.
\v 2 Simon Peter and Thomas called ‘The Twin’, and Nathanael of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee and two of his other disciples, were together.
\v 3 Simon Peter told them, “I am going out to fish.”
\p They said to him, “We too! We are coming with you.” They set off at once and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
\v 4 As day was dawning Jesus stood on the shore. However, the disciples were not aware that it was Jesus.
\v 5 So Jesus asked them, “Lads, have you anything to eat?”
\p They answered him, “No!”
\p
\v 6 He told them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find [something].”
\p So they made a cast, but then could not draw it in because of the huge number of fish.
\v 7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!”
\p When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he put on his coat, for he had stripped, and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 But the other disciples came by boat – for they were not far from the land, perhaps a hundred yards off – dragging the net of fish.
\v 9 Now when they came ashore they saw a charcoal fire laid out and fish lying on it, and bread.
\v 10 Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”
\p
\v 11 Simon Peter embarked and dragged the net ashore, full of large fish – one hundred and fifty-three – and though there were so many the net was not torn.
\p
\v 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.”
\p And none of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?”, knowing that it was the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish in the same way.
\v 14 This was now the third time that Jesus, having risen from the dead, had been revealed to his disciples.
\p
\v 15 Now when they had eaten Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?”
\p He told him, “Yes, Lord. You know that I love you.”
\p He said to him, “Feed my lambs.”
\v 16 He asked him again, a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?”
\p Peter replied, “Yes, Lord. You know that I love you.”
\p He said to him, “Tend my sheep.”
\v 17 He asked him a third time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?”
\p Peter was distressed because he asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” and he said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.”
\p Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.”
\v 18 “Truly, truly, I tell you that when you were young you were dressing yourself and going wherever you wanted, but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you and carry you where you would rather not go.”
\p
\v 19 Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God. Having said this he told him, “Follow me.”
\p
\v 20 Turning round, Peter saw, following, the disciple whom Jesus loved – the one who at supper had leant on his breast and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”
\v 21 Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”
\p
\v 22 Jesus answered him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You, follow me.”
\v 23 So this saying spread among the brothers and sisters that this disciple would not die; but Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”
\v 24 This is the disciple who bears witness to these things. He has also written these things and we know that his testimony is true.
\v 25 Now there are also many other things which Jesus did. If they were to be recorded individually I suppose that not even the world itself could accommodate the books that would be written.
\p
