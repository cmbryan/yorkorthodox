York Orthodox Calendar Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scripts create and use two SQLite databases: 'YOCal.db' and 'YOCal_Master.db'.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YOCal.db is the basic reference for the project. 
     The first four tables to be created contain fixed data:
        A_Lections: The Apostle reading references for the Pascha, Pentecost, and Lenten cycles.
        G_Lections: The Gospel cycle references and also the Extra readings, e.g. For the Departed.
        Menaion: All data of fixed date - their commemorations, readings, and much else.
        Pascha: The dates of Pascha. The capability of the database is limited by the dates provided.

        The data for these tables are provided by four tab-delimited text files. 

   Script 1 creates the database and populates the four fixed tables from their text files.
   
   Script 2 creates a series of year table. 100 tables covering 2000-2099 is currently possible.
   
   Scripts 3-7 populate these year tables. The complex relationship between the Paschalion and 
               Menaion cycles requires that they be run in order.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YOCal_Master.db is the portable working database which is queried for each day's data.
     It has two tables: 'yocal_main' and 'yocal_lections'.
        yocal_main has one record for each calendar date containing everything except 
                   the text of the readings.
        yocal_lections has the text of each reading, referenced by code. The code refers either
                       to the Apostle/Gospel cycle or to a fixed date of the Menaion.

   Script 8 creates the database and its tables.

   Script 9 populates yocal_main with data for one or more years by querying YOCal.db. 
            Selecting a range of six or seven years results in a DB of around 5mb.

   Script 10 populates yocal_lections by importing the bible text for each reference.
             The text is taken from WEBBE_NTv3.txt or LXXv2.txt as appropriate.

   Script 11 is needed because of anomalies in lection references and verse boundaries.

Querying YOCal_Master.db and other utility scripts

   Script 20 writes new copies of the tables of fixed data in YOCal.db to csv text files.

   Script 21 dumps the table yocal_lections to a MySQL file suitable for importing into a web DB.

   Script 22 dumps the table yocal_main to a similar MySQL file.

   Script 91 creates a formatted HTML file suitable for printing with data for one month or more.

   Script 92 modifies the 'Fathers' doc text so it is suitable for uploading to the website.

   template_ss_rdgs.php is a Wordpress page template which diplays the daily data and readings.
